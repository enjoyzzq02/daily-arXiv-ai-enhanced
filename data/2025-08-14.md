*Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Sufyaan Zahoor,Areeb Manzoor,Musharaf Maqbool,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态框架用于检测社交媒体上的厌女和性别歧视内容，包含三个模块，并在两个数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上针对女性的攻击性内容较多，现有方法难以有效检测，需针对性解决方案。

Method: 提出多模态框架，包含注意力模块（MANM）、图特征重构模块（GFRM）和内容特征学习模块（CFLM），结合文本和图像特征。

Result: 在MAMI和MMHS150K数据集上，平均宏F1分数分别提升10.17%和8.88%。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效检测厌女和性别歧视内容，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: A substantial portion of offensive content on social media is directed
towards women. Since the approaches for general offensive content detection
face a challenge in detecting misogynistic content, it requires solutions
tailored to address offensive content against women. To this end, we propose a
novel multimodal framework for the detection of misogynistic and sexist
content. The framework comprises three modules: the Multimodal Attention module
(MANM), the Graph-based Feature Reconstruction Module (GFRM), and the
Content-specific Features Learning Module (CFLM). The MANM employs adaptive
gating-based multimodal context-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on
relevant visual and textual information and generating contextually relevant
features. The GFRM module utilizes graphs to refine features within individual
modalities, while the CFLM focuses on learning text and image-specific features
such as toxicity features and caption features. Additionally, we curate a set
of misogynous lexicons to compute the misogyny-specific lexicon score from the
text. We apply test-time augmentation in feature space to better generalize the
predictions on diverse inputs. The performance of the proposed approach has
been evaluated on two multimodal datasets, MAMI and MMHS150K, with 11,000 and
13,494 samples, respectively. The proposed method demonstrates an average
improvement of 10.17% and 8.88% in macro-F1 over existing methods on the MAMI
and MMHS150K datasets, respectively.

### [2] [IAD-R1: Reinforcing Consistent Reasoning in Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09178)
*Yanhui Li,Yunkang Cao,Chengliang Liu,Yuan Xiong,Xinghui Dong,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IAD-R1是一个通用的后训练框架，显著提升了视觉语言模型在工业异常检测中的性能，通过两阶段训练策略实现从异常感知到异常解释的能力跃升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常检测中缺陷样本稀缺，传统方法泛化能力有限，视觉语言模型虽具优势但表现不足。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：PA-SFT阶段使用高质量Chain-of-Thought数据集增强异常感知能力；SC-GRPO阶段通过奖励函数实现能力跃升。

Result: 在7种VLMs上平均准确率提升43.3%，0.5B参数模型在零样本设置下超越GPT-4.1等商业模型。

Conclusion: IAD-R1框架有效且优越，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is a critical component of modern manufacturing,
yet the scarcity of defective samples restricts traditional detection methods
to scenario-specific applications. Although Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
demonstrate significant advantages in generalization capabilities, their
performance in industrial anomaly detection remains limited. To address this
challenge, we propose IAD-R1, a universal post-training framework applicable to
VLMs of different architectures and parameter scales, which substantially
enhances their anomaly detection capabilities. IAD-R1 employs a two-stage
training strategy: the Perception Activation Supervised Fine-Tuning (PA-SFT)
stage utilizes a meticulously constructed high-quality Chain-of-Thought dataset
(Expert-AD) for training, enhancing anomaly perception capabilities and
establishing reasoning-to-answer correlations; the Structured Control Group
Relative Policy Optimization (SC-GRPO) stage employs carefully designed reward
functions to achieve a capability leap from "Anomaly Perception" to "Anomaly
Interpretation". Experimental results demonstrate that IAD-R1 achieves
significant improvements across 7 VLMs, attaining up to 43.3% enhancement in
average accuracy on 6 industrial anomaly detection benchmark datasets. Notably,
the 0.5B parameter model trained with IAD-R1 surpasses commercial models
including GPT-4.1 and Claude-Sonnet-4 in zero-shot settings, demonstrating the
effectiveness and superiority of IAD-R1. The dataset, code, and all model
weights will be publicly available at https://github.com/Yanhui-Lee/IAD-R1.

### [3] [A Neurosymbolic Framework for Interpretable Cognitive Attack Detection in Augmented Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09185)
*Rongqian Chen,Allison Andreyev,Yanming Xiu,Mahdi Imani,Bin Li,Maria Gorlatova,Gang Tan,Tian Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADAR是一种新型神经符号方法，用于检测AR中的认知攻击，结合了视觉语言模型和粒子滤波技术，提高了检测准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AR认知攻击检测方法要么局限于视觉层面的处理，要么依赖黑盒式的预训练视觉语言模型，缺乏语义推理能力和可解释性。

Method: CADAR通过融合多模态视觉语言输入生成符号感知图，结合先验知识、显著权重和时间相关性，利用粒子滤波进行统计推理。

Result: 在扩展的AR认知攻击数据集上，CADAR比基线方法准确率提高了10.7%。

Conclusion: 神经符号方法在AR认知攻击检测中具有高效性和可解释性的潜力。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) enriches perception by overlaying virtual elements on
the physical world. Due to its growing popularity, cognitive attacks that alter
AR content to manipulate users' semantic perception have received increasing
attention. Existing detection methods often focus on visual changes, which are
restricted to pixel- or image-level processing and lack semantic reasoning
capabilities, or they rely on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), which
function as black-box approaches with limited interpretability. In this paper,
we present CADAR, a novel neurosymbolic approach for cognitive attack detection
in AR. It fuses multimodal vision-language inputs using neural VLMs to obtain a
symbolic perception-graph representation, incorporating prior knowledge,
salience weighting, and temporal correlations. The model then enables
particle-filter based statistical reasoning -- a sequential Monte Carlo method
-- to detect cognitive attacks. Thus, CADAR inherits the adaptability of
pre-trained VLM and the interpretability and reasoning rigor of particle
filtering. Experiments on an extended AR cognitive attack dataset show accuracy
improvements of up to 10.7% over strong baselines on challenging AR attack
scenarios, underscoring the promise of neurosymbolic methods for effective and
interpretable cognitive attack detection.

### [4] [RL-MoE: An Image-Based Privacy Preserving Approach In Intelligent Transportation System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09186)
*Abdolazim Rezaei,Mehdi Sookhak,Mahboobeh Haghparast*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RL-MoE框架通过将敏感视觉数据转换为隐私保护文本描述，解决了智能交通系统中隐私与数据效用之间的冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能交通系统中AI摄像头的普及引发了隐私与数据需求之间的冲突，现有隐私保护机制不足。

Method: 结合混合专家架构（MoE）和强化学习（RL）代理，将视觉数据转换为隐私保护的文本描述。

Result: RL-MoE在CFP-FP数据集上降低了重放攻击成功率至9.4%，同时生成更丰富的文本内容。

Conclusion: RL-MoE为隐私敏感领域提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，推动了更安全的智能城市和自动驾驶网络。

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-powered cameras in Intelligent Transportation Systems
(ITS) creates a severe conflict between the need for rich visual data and the
fundamental right to privacy. Existing privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as
blurring or encryption, are often insufficient, creating an undesirable
trade-off where either privacy is compromised against advanced reconstruction
attacks or data utility is critically degraded. To resolve this impasse, we
propose RL-MoE, a novel framework that transforms sensitive visual data into
privacy-preserving textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct image
transmission. RL-MoE uniquely combines a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
for nuanced, multi-aspect scene decomposition with a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) agent that optimizes the generated text for a dual objective of semantic
accuracy and privacy preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RL-MoE provides superior privacy protection, reducing the success rate of
replay attacks to just 9.4\% on the CFP-FP dataset, while simultaneously
generating richer textual content than baseline methods. Our work provides a
practical and scalable solution for building trustworthy AI systems in
privacy-sensitive domains, paving the way for more secure smart city and
autonomous vehicle networks.

### [5] [Synthetic Data Generation for Emotional Depth Faces: Optimizing Conditional DCGANs via Genetic Algorithms in the Latent Space and Stabilizing Training with Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09188)
*Seyed Muhammad Hossein Mousavi,S. Younes Mirinezhad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于优化GAN和知识蒸馏的合成深度人脸生成框架，结合遗传算法提升多样性和质量，在情感分类任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决情感计算中高质量、多样化深度人脸数据集不足的问题。

Method: 使用优化GAN和知识蒸馏（EMA教师模型）生成合成深度人脸，结合遗传算法优化潜在向量，提取多种特征进行分类。

Result: 在多样性和质量上优于GAN、VAE、GMM和KDE，分类准确率达94%和96%。

Conclusion: 该方法在生成和分类任务中均优于现有技术，为情感计算提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Affective computing faces a major challenge: the lack of high-quality,
diverse depth facial datasets for recognizing subtle emotional expressions. We
propose a framework for synthetic depth face generation using an optimized GAN
with Knowledge Distillation (EMA teacher models) to stabilize training, improve
quality, and prevent mode collapse. We also apply Genetic Algorithms to evolve
GAN latent vectors based on image statistics, boosting diversity and visual
quality for target emotions. The approach outperforms GAN, VAE, GMM, and KDE in
both diversity and quality. For classification, we extract and concatenate LBP,
HOG, Sobel edge, and intensity histogram features, achieving 94% and 96%
accuracy with XGBoost. Evaluation using FID, IS, SSIM, and PSNR shows
consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

### [6] [$Δ$-AttnMask: Attention-Guided Masked Hidden States for Efficient Data Selection and Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09199)
*Jucheng Hu,Suorong Yang,Dongzhan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Δ-AttnMask的数据高效框架，用于视觉指令微调（VIF），通过注意力引导的隐藏状态掩码量化样本质量，仅需20%数据即可实现最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉指令微调（VIF）需要多模态数据以支持视觉和文本的联合理解，但数据选择问题尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出Δ-AttnMask框架，通过计算原始状态与高注意力区域掩码状态的损失差异（Δ）来评估样本质量，无需额外标签或训练。

Result: 实验表明，Δ-AttnMask仅需20%数据即可实现5倍训练加速，并在整体准确率上超过全数据集基线10.1%。

Conclusion: Δ-AttnMask是一种模型无关且数据无关的设计，适用于多种模态和架构，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Visual Instruction Finetuning (VIF) is pivotal for post-training
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Unlike unimodal instruction finetuning in
plain-text large language models, which mainly requires instruction datasets to
enable model instruction-following ability, VIF also requires multimodal data
to enable joint visual and textual understanding; therefore, it typically
requires more data. Consequently, VIF imposes stricter data selection
challenges: the method must scale efficiently to handle larger data demands
while ensuring the quality of both visual and textual content, as well as their
alignment. Despite its critical impact on performance, data selection for VIF
remains an understudied area. In this paper, we propose $\Delta$-AttnMask. This
data-efficient framework quantifies sample quality through attention-guided
masking of the model's hidden states, jointly evaluating image-text pairs
without requiring domain labels, auxiliary models, or extra training. By
computing loss differences ($\Delta$) between the original states and states
masked using high-attention regions, $\Delta$-AttnMask intrinsically assesses
sample quality. Experiments across multiple VLMs and datasets show that
$\Delta$-AttnMask achieves state-of-the-art performance with just 20% of data,
accelerating training by 5x while surpassing full-dataset baselines by +10.1%
in overall accuracy. Its model-agnostic and data-agnostic design ensures broad
applicability across modalities and architectures.

### [7] [Personalized Feature Translation for Expression Recognition: An Efficient Source-Free Domain Adaptation Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09202)
*Masoumeh Sharafi,Soufiane Belharbi,Houssem Ben Salem,Ali Etemad,Alessandro Lameiras Koerich,Marco Pedersoli,Simon Bacon,Eric Granger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的个性化特征翻译（PFT）方法，用于源自由域适应（SFDA），以解决面部表情识别（FER）模型在仅含中性表情的无标签目标数据上的适应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SFDA方法通常不适用于仅含单类目标数据的情况，且基于图像生成的方法不稳定且计算量大。本文旨在通过潜在空间中的特征翻译，避免图像合成的复杂性，提高模型效率。

Method: 提出PFT方法，先在源域数据上预训练翻译器，将源主题的风格特征转换为另一主题，同时优化表情一致性和风格感知目标。随后仅用中性目标数据适应翻译器，无需源数据或图像合成。

Result: PFT在潜在空间中进行翻译，避免了表情生成的复杂性和噪声，生成优化的分类嵌入，同时减少了计算开销。

Conclusion: PFT方法高效且轻量，无需图像合成，仅需部分模型适应，显著提升了FER模型在目标域中的性能。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) models are employed in many video-based
affective computing applications, such as human-computer interaction and
healthcare monitoring. However, deep FER models often struggle with subtle
expressions and high inter-subject variability, limiting their performance in
real-world applications. To improve their performance, source-free domain
adaptation (SFDA) methods have been proposed to personalize a pretrained source
model using only unlabeled target domain data, thereby avoiding data privacy,
storage, and transmission constraints. This paper addresses a challenging
scenario where source data is unavailable for adaptation, and only unlabeled
target data consisting solely of neutral expressions is available. SFDA methods
are not typically designed to adapt using target data from only a single class.
Further, using models to generate facial images with non-neutral expressions
can be unstable and computationally intensive. In this paper, personalized
feature translation (PFT) is proposed for SFDA. Unlike current image
translation methods for SFDA, our lightweight method operates in the latent
space. We first pre-train the translator on the source domain data to transform
the subject-specific style features from one source subject into another.
Expression information is preserved by optimizing a combination of expression
consistency and style-aware objectives. Then, the translator is adapted on
neutral target data, without using source data or image synthesis. By
translating in the latent space, PFT avoids the complexity and noise of face
expression generation, producing discriminative embeddings optimized for
classification. Using PFT eliminates the need for image synthesis, reduces
computational overhead (using a lightweight translator), and only adapts part
of the model, making the method efficient compared to image-based translation.

### [8] [A Signer-Invariant Conformer and Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer for Continuous Sign Language Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09372)
*Md Rezwanul Haque,Md. Milon Islam,S M Taslim Uddin Raju,Fakhri Karray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双架构框架，分别针对手语识别中的独立于说话者和未见句子问题，通过新型网络结构显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续手语识别（CSLR）面临说话者间差异大和对新句子结构泛化能力差的问题，传统方法难以有效解决。

Method: 提出Signer-Invariant Conformer（结合卷积与多头自注意力）处理说话者独立问题，设计Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer（双路径时间编码器）处理未见句子问题。

Result: 在Isharah-1000数据集上，Conformer架构在说话者独立任务中WER降至13.07%，Transformer在未见句子任务中WER为47.78%，均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 任务特定网络设计显著提升CSLR性能，为未来研究设定了新基准。

Abstract: Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) faces multiple challenges,
including significant inter-signer variability and poor generalization to novel
sentence structures. Traditional solutions frequently fail to handle these
issues efficiently. For overcoming these constraints, we propose a
dual-architecture framework. For the Signer-Independent (SI) challenge, we
propose a Signer-Invariant Conformer that combines convolutions with multi-head
self-attention to learn robust, signer-agnostic representations from pose-based
skeletal keypoints. For the Unseen-Sentences (US) task, we designed a
Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer with a novel dual-path temporal encoder that
captures both fine-grained posture dynamics, enabling the model's ability to
comprehend novel grammatical compositions. Experiments on the challenging
Isharah-1000 dataset establish a new standard for both CSLR benchmarks. The
proposed conformer architecture achieves a Word Error Rate (WER) of 13.07% on
the SI challenge, a reduction of 13.53% from the state-of-the-art. On the US
task, the transformer model scores a WER of 47.78%, surpassing previous work.
In the SignEval 2025 CSLR challenge, our team placed 2nd in the US task and 4th
in the SI task, demonstrating the performance of these models. The findings
validate our key hypothesis: that developing task-specific networks designed
for the particular challenges of CSLR leads to considerable performance
improvements and establishes a new baseline for further research. The source
code is available at: https://github.com/rezwanh001/MSLR-Pose86K-CSLR-Isharah.

Abstract: The process of generating fully colorized drawings from sketches is a large,
usually costly bottleneck in the manga and anime industry. In this study, we
examine multiple models for image-to-image translation between anime characters
and their sketches, including Neural Style Transfer, C-GAN, and CycleGAN. By
assessing them qualitatively and quantitatively, we find that C-GAN is the most
effective model that is able to produce high-quality and high-resolution images
close to those created by humans.

TL;DR: MME-Emotion是一个系统性基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的情感情感和推理能力，揭示了当前模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前情感基准测试在泛化能力和推理能力方面存在不足，MME-Emotion旨在填补这些空白。

Method: MME-Emotion包含6,000多个视频片段和任务特定的问答对，涵盖八种情感任务，并通过多智能体系统框架进行分析。

Result: 评估20个先进MLLMs显示，其情感智能表现不佳，最佳模型的识别分数仅为39.3%，推理分数为56.0%。

Conclusion: MME-Emotion为未来提升MLLMs情感智能提供了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have catalyzed
transformative progress in affective computing, enabling models to exhibit
emergent emotional intelligence. Despite substantial methodological progress,
current emotional benchmarks remain limited, as it is still unknown: (a) the
generalization abilities of MLLMs across distinct scenarios, and (b) their
reasoning capabilities to identify the triggering factors behind emotional
states. To bridge these gaps, we present \textbf{MME-Emotion}, a systematic
benchmark that assesses both emotional understanding and reasoning capabilities
of MLLMs, enjoying \textit{scalable capacity}, \textit{diverse settings}, and
\textit{unified protocols}. As the largest emotional intelligence benchmark for
MLLMs, MME-Emotion contains over 6,000 curated video clips with task-specific
questioning-answering (QA) pairs, spanning broad scenarios to formulate eight
emotional tasks. It further incorporates a holistic evaluation suite with
hybrid metrics for emotion recognition and reasoning, analyzed through a
multi-agent system framework. Through a rigorous evaluation of 20 advanced
MLLMs, we uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key
insights: \ding{182} Current MLLMs exhibit unsatisfactory emotional
intelligence, with the best-performing model achieving only $39.3\%$
recognition score and $56.0\%$ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) score on our benchmark.
\ding{183} Generalist models (\emph{e.g.}, Gemini-2.5-Pro) derive emotional
intelligence from generalized multimodal understanding capabilities, while
specialist models (\emph{e.g.}, R1-Omni) can achieve comparable performance
through domain-specific post-training adaptation. By introducing MME-Emotion,
we hope that it can serve as a foundation for advancing MLLMs' emotional
intelligence in the future.

*Zuoou Li,Weitong Zhang,Jingyuan Wang,Shuyuan Zhang,Wenjia Bai,Bernhard Kainz,Mengyun Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个四轴评估框架，用于更准确地评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的对抗性提示漏洞，并开发了一种递归重写策略（BSD），显著提高了攻击成功率和危害性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估标准可能高估了对抗性提示的有效性，且安全机制未能有效阻止有害输出。

Method: 引入四轴评估框架（输入相关性、输入分布外强度、输出危害性、输出拒绝率），并开发BSD策略，通过语义对齐子任务和视觉线索优化提示。

Result: BSD在13个MLLMs上测试，攻击成功率提高67%，危害性提高21%。

Conclusion: 揭示了当前多模态安全系统的潜在弱点，BSD策略显著提升了对抗性攻击的效果。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are widely used in vision-language
reasoning tasks. However, their vulnerability to adversarial prompts remains a
serious concern, as safety mechanisms often fail to prevent the generation of
harmful outputs. Although recent jailbreak strategies report high success
rates, many responses classified as "successful" are actually benign, vague, or
unrelated to the intended malicious goal. This mismatch suggests that current
evaluation standards may overestimate the effectiveness of such attacks. To
address this issue, we introduce a four-axis evaluation framework that
considers input on-topicness, input out-of-distribution (OOD) intensity, output
harmfulness, and output refusal rate. This framework identifies truly effective
jailbreaks. In a substantial empirical study, we reveal a structural trade-off:
highly on-topic prompts are frequently blocked by safety filters, whereas those
that are too OOD often evade detection but fail to produce harmful content.
However, prompts that balance relevance and novelty are more likely to evade
filters and trigger dangerous output. Building on this insight, we develop a
recursive rewriting strategy called Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD).
The approach restructures malicious prompts into semantically aligned
sub-tasks, while introducing subtle OOD signals and visual cues that make the
inputs harder to detect. BSD was tested across 13 commercial and open-source
MLLMs, where it consistently led to higher attack success rates, more harmful
outputs, and fewer refusals. Compared to previous methods, it improves success
rates by $67\%$ and harmfulness by $21\%$, revealing a previously
underappreciated weakness in current multimodal safety systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手写数学表达式识别（HMER）领域因数据稀缺而受限，主要由于手动标注成本高昂。

Method: 开发可扩展的数据引擎生成复杂LaTeX序列，结合手写公式与大规模LaTeX渲染公式，构建Tex80M数据集，并训练TexTeller模型。

Result: TexTeller在几乎所有基准测试中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 论文将公开模型、数据集和代码，推动HMER领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Large foundation models have achieved significant performance gains through
scalable training on massive datasets. However, the field of
\textbf{H}andwritten \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{E}xpression
\textbf{R}ecognition (HMER) has been impeded by the scarcity of data, primarily
due to the arduous and costly process of manual annotation. To bridge this gap,
we propose a novel method integrating limited handwritten formulas with
large-scale LaTeX-rendered formulas by developing a scalable data engine to
generate complex and consistent LaTeX sequences. With this engine, we built the
largest formula dataset to date, termed \texttt{Tex80M}, comprising over 80
million high-quality training instances. Then we propose \texttt{TexTeller},
the first HMER model trained at scale, by mix-training \texttt{Tex80M} with a
relatively small HME dataset. The expansive training dataset and our refined
pipeline have equipped \texttt{TexTeller} with state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance across nearly all benchmarks. To advance the field, we will openly
release our complete model, entire dataset, and full codebase, enabling further
research building upon our contributions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GDAGS通过梯度方向感知的自适应密度控制框架，解决了3D高斯泼溅中的过重建和过密集问题，显著提升了渲染质量并减少了50%的内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅方法在复杂场景中存在过重建和过密集问题，导致内存开销增加和渲染质量下降。

Method: 提出GDAGS框架，利用梯度一致性比（GCR）和非线性动态加权机制，实现梯度方向感知的密度控制。

Result: GDAGS在多种真实场景基准测试中表现出色，显著减少了过重建和过密集问题，内存消耗降低50%。

Conclusion: GDAGS通过优化高斯利用，实现了更紧凑的场景表示和更高的渲染质量。

Abstract: The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has significantly advanced
novel view synthesis through explicit scene representation, enabling real-time
photorealistic rendering. However, existing approaches manifest two critical
limitations in complex scenarios: (1) Over-reconstruction occurs when
persistent large Gaussians cannot meet adaptive splitting thresholds during
density control. This is exacerbated by conflicting gradient directions that
prevent effective splitting of these Gaussians; (2) Over-densification of
Gaussians occurs in regions with aligned gradient aggregation, leading to
redundant component proliferation. This redundancy significantly increases
memory overhead due to unnecessary data retention. We present
Gradient-Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GDAGS), a gradient-direction-aware
adaptive density control framework to address these challenges. Our key
innovations: the gradient coherence ratio (GCR), computed through normalized
gradient vector norms, which explicitly discriminates Gaussians with concordant
versus conflicting gradient directions; and a nonlinear dynamic weighting
mechanism leverages the GCR to enable gradient-direction-aware density control.
Specifically, GDAGS prioritizes conflicting-gradient Gaussians during splitting
operations to enhance geometric details while suppressing redundant
concordant-direction Gaussians. Conversely, in cloning processes, GDAGS
promotes concordant-direction Gaussian densification for structural completion
while preventing conflicting-direction Gaussian overpopulation. Comprehensive
evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that GDAGS
achieves superior rendering quality while effectively mitigating
over-reconstruction, suppressing over-densification, and constructing compact
scene representations with 50\% reduced memory consumption through optimized
Gaussians utilization.

Conclusion: FineState-Bench首次证实当前GUI代理的主要瓶颈是基本视觉定位能力，所有资源已开源。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence technology,
Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated tremendous potential
for autonomously managing daily tasks through natural language instructions.
However, current evaluation frameworks for GUI agents suffer from fundamental
flaws: existing benchmarks overly focus on coarse-grained task completion while
neglecting fine-grained control capabilities crucial for real-world
applications. To address this, we introduce FineState-Bench, the first
evaluation and diagnostic standard for fine-grained GUI proxy operations,
designed to quantify fine-grained control. This multi-platform (desktop, Web,
mobile) framework includes 2257 task benchmarks in four components and uses a
four-phase indicator for comprehensive perception-to-control assessment. To
analyze perception and positioning for refined operations, we developed the
plug-and-play Visual Diagnostic Assistant (VDA), enabling the first
quantitative decoupling analysis of these capabilities. Experimental results on
our benchmark show that the most advanced models achieve only 32.8%
fine-grained interaction accuracy. Using our VDA in controlled experiments,
quantifying the impact of visual capabilities, we showed that ideal visual
localization boosts Gemini-2.5-Flash's success rate by 14.9\%. Our diagnostic
framework confirms for the first time that the primary bottleneck for current
GUI proxies is basic visual positioning capability.All resources are fully

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型的普及，盲人和低视力用户可能无意中捕获隐私信息，现有方法因粗粒度屏蔽影响可用性。

Method: 结合细粒度分割与数据驱动的风险评分机制，选择性屏蔽高风险隐私信息。

Result: 在BIV-Priv-Seg数据集上，FiGPriv保留26%的图像内容，提升模型响应能力11%，识别能力45%。

Conclusion: FiGPriv在保护隐私的同时显著提升了视觉语言模型的可用性和功能性。

Abstract: As visual assistant systems powered by visual language models (VLMs) become
more prevalent, concerns over user privacy have grown, particularly for blind
and low vision users who may unknowingly capture personal private information
in their images. Existing privacy protection methods rely on coarse-grained
segmentation, which uniformly masks entire private objects, often at the cost
of usability. In this work, we propose FiGPriv, a fine-grained privacy
protection framework that selectively masks only high-risk private information
while preserving low-risk information. Our approach integrates fine-grained
segmentation with a data-driven risk scoring mechanism. We evaluate our
framework using the BIV-Priv-Seg dataset and show that FiG-Priv preserves +26%
of image content, enhancing the ability of VLMs to provide useful responses by
11% and identify the image content by 45%, while ensuring privacy protection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型输入自适应导航方法，通过三种算法提升视觉与语言导航模型的效率，显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有输入自适应机制在减少计算量的同时会导致性能显著下降，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 提出三种自适应算法：选择性处理全景视图、重要性自适应阈值和缓存机制。

Result: 在七个VLN基准测试中，计算量减少超过2倍。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了模型效率，适用于计算资源有限的实际场景。

Abstract: An emerging paradigm in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is the use of
history-aware multi-modal transformer models. Given a language instruction,
these models process observation and navigation history to predict the most
appropriate action for an agent. While they have significantly improved
performance, the scale of these models can be a bottleneck in practical
settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we propose a novel
input-adaptive navigation method to enhance VLN model efficiency. We first show
that existing input-adaptive mechanisms fail to reduce computations without
substantial performance degradation. To address this, we introduce three
adaptive algorithms, each deployed at a different level: (1) To improve spatial
efficiency, we selectively process panoramic views at each observation of an
agent. (2) To improve intra-model efficiency, we propose importance-based
adaptive thresholding for the early-exit methods. (3) To improve temporal
efficiency, we implement a caching mechanism that prevents reprocessing of
views previously seen by the agent. In evaluations on seven VLN benchmarks, we
demonstrate over a 2$\times$ reduction in computation across three
off-the-shelf agents in both standard and continuous environments. Our code is
publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉强化学习面临高维输入和噪声奖励的挑战，现有大模型在RL中的整合效果不明确，需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 提出SegDAC方法，利用SAM进行对象中心分解，YOLO-World通过文本提示语义标注，结合新型Transformer架构动态学习关注的分段。

Result: 在Maniskill3基准测试中，SegDAC在视觉泛化能力上表现优异，最难任务性能翻倍，样本效率优于或匹配现有方法。

Conclusion: SegDAC通过对象中心分解和动态学习机制，显著提升了视觉强化学习的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the need to learn
both perception and actions from high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards.
Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL
for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains unclear. We
propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment
Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground
segments semantically via text prompts. It includes a novel transformer-based
architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and
effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using
human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization
benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under
strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly
better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting
and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all
evaluated tasks.

Motivation: 现有生成模型在肺部癌症诊断中效率低且解剖学不精确，限制了其临床应用。

Method: 采用基于结节语义布局的去噪扩散概率模型（DDPM），并通过肺部DPM-solver加速，专注于病变区域。

Conclusion: Lung-DDPM+能高效生成高质量肺部CT图像，具有广泛临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been playing an important role in
various domains. Leveraging its high capability to generate high-fidelity and
diverse synthetic data, generative AI is widely applied in diagnostic tasks,
such as lung cancer diagnosis using computed tomography (CT). However, existing
generative models for lung cancer diagnosis suffer from low efficiency and
anatomical imprecision, which limit their clinical applicability. To address
these drawbacks, we propose Lung-DDPM+, an improved version of our previous
model, Lung-DDPM. This novel approach is a denoising diffusion probabilistic
model (DDPM) guided by nodule semantic layouts and accelerated by a pulmonary
DPM-solver, enabling the method to focus on lesion areas while achieving a
better trade-off between sampling efficiency and quality. Evaluation results on
the public LIDC-IDRI dataset suggest that the proposed method achieves
8$\times$ fewer FLOPs (floating point operations per second), 6.8$\times$ lower
GPU memory consumption, and 14$\times$ faster sampling compared to Lung-DDPM.
Moreover, it maintains comparable sample quality to both Lung-DDPM and other
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in two downstream segmentation tasks.
We also conducted a Visual Turing Test by an experienced radiologist, showing
the advanced quality and fidelity of synthetic samples generated by the
proposed method. These experimental results demonstrate that Lung-DDPM+ can
effectively generate high-quality thoracic CT images with lung nodules,
highlighting its potential for broader applications, such as general tumor
synthesis and lesion generation in medical imaging. The code and pretrained
models are available at https://github.com/Manem-Lab/Lung-DDPM-PLUS.

Conclusion: 基于注意力融合的多样化时空网络集成方法为复杂多模态手势识别提供了鲁棒且高精度的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate recognition of sign language in healthcare communication poses a
significant challenge, requiring frameworks that can accurately interpret
complex multimodal gestures. To deal with this, we propose FusionEnsemble-Net,
a novel attention-based ensemble of spatiotemporal networks that dynamically
fuses visual and motion data to enhance recognition accuracy. The proposed
approach processes RGB video and range Doppler map radar modalities
synchronously through four different spatiotemporal networks. For each network,
features from both modalities are continuously fused using an attention-based
fusion module before being fed into an ensemble of classifiers. Finally, the
outputs of these four different fused channels are combined in an ensemble
classification head, thereby enhancing the model's robustness. Experiments
demonstrate that FusionEnsemble-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
with a test accuracy of 99.44% on the large-scale MultiMeDaLIS dataset for
Italian Sign Language. Our findings indicate that an ensemble of diverse
spatiotemporal networks, unified by attention-based fusion, yields a robust and
accurate framework for complex, multimodal isolated gesture recognition tasks.

Motivation: 医学图像分割中存在标注者间差异，尤其是边界模糊的病变（如恶性皮肤病变），研究这种差异的成因及其影响有助于提升分割模型的性能。

Method: 研究团队构建了IMA++数据集，分析了标注者、恶性程度、工具和技能对差异的影响，并提出了一种基于多任务学习的方法，利用标注者间一致性作为软临床特征。

Result: 研究发现标注者间一致性与病变恶性程度显著相关（p<0.001），并成功预测了一致性（平均绝对误差0.108）。多任务学习方法在多个数据集上平均提升了4.2%的平衡准确率。

Conclusion: 标注者间一致性可作为提升医学图像分割模型性能的有效特征，尤其是在边界模糊的病变中。该方法在多个数据集上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation exhibits intra- and inter-annotator variability
due to ambiguous object boundaries, annotator preferences, expertise, and
tools, among other factors. Lesions with ambiguous boundaries, e.g., spiculated
or infiltrative nodules, or irregular borders per the ABCD rule, are
particularly prone to disagreement and are often associated with malignancy. In
this work, we curate IMA++, the largest multi-annotator skin lesion
segmentation dataset, on which we conduct an in-depth study of variability due
to annotator, malignancy, tool, and skill factors. We find a statistically
significant (p<0.001) association between inter-annotator agreement (IAA),
measured using Dice, and the malignancy of skin lesions. We further show that
IAA can be accurately predicted directly from dermoscopic images, achieving a
mean absolute error of 0.108. Finally, we leverage this association by
utilizing IAA as a "soft" clinical feature within a multi-task learning
objective, yielding a 4.2% improvement in balanced accuracy averaged across
multiple model architectures and across IMA++ and four public dermoscopic
datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/sfu-mial/skin-IAV.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式骨骼姿势和启发式跨身份调整，限制了运动的表达性和通用性。X-UniMotion旨在通过隐式潜在表示解决这一问题。

Method: 采用自监督端到端框架，将多粒度运动编码为四个解耦的潜在标记（面部、身体、双手），并结合DiT生成模型和辅助解码器优化学习。

Result: 实验表明，X-UniMotion在运动保真度和身份保持方面优于现有方法，生成高度表达的动画。

Conclusion: X-UniMotion通过隐式潜在表示和自监督学习，实现了高保真、跨身份的全身运动迁移，为运动生成领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present X-UniMotion, a unified and expressive implicit latent
representation for whole-body human motion, encompassing facial expressions,
body poses, and hand gestures. Unlike prior motion transfer methods that rely
on explicit skeletal poses and heuristic cross-identity adjustments, our
approach encodes multi-granular motion directly from a single image into a
compact set of four disentangled latent tokens -- one for facial expression,
one for body pose, and one for each hand. These motion latents are both highly
expressive and identity-agnostic, enabling high-fidelity, detailed
cross-identity motion transfer across subjects with diverse identities, poses,
and spatial configurations. To achieve this, we introduce a self-supervised,
end-to-end framework that jointly learns the motion encoder and latent
representation alongside a DiT-based video generative model, trained on
large-scale, diverse human motion datasets. Motion-identity disentanglement is
enforced via 2D spatial and color augmentations, as well as synthetic 3D
renderings of cross-identity subject pairs under shared poses. Furthermore, we
guide motion token learning with auxiliary decoders that promote fine-grained,
semantically aligned, and depth-aware motion embeddings. Extensive experiments
show that X-UniMotion outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing highly
expressive animations with superior motion fidelity and identity preservation.

Conclusion: DenoDet V2通过变换域特征调制，显著提升了性能并降低了复杂度，为SAR目标检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: One of the primary challenges in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object
detection lies in the pervasive influence of coherent noise. As a common
practice, most existing methods, whether handcrafted approaches or deep
learning-based methods, employ the analysis or enhancement of object
spatial-domain characteristics to achieve implicit denoising. In this paper, we
propose DenoDet V2, which explores a completely novel and different perspective
to deconstruct and modulate the features in the transform domain via a
carefully designed attention architecture. Compared to DenoDet V1, DenoDet V2
is a major advancement that exploits the complementary nature of amplitude and
phase information through a band-wise mutual modulation mechanism, which
enables a reciprocal enhancement between phase and amplitude spectra. Extensive
experiments on various SAR datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of DenoDet V2. Notably, DenoDet V2 achieves a significant 0.8\%
improvement on SARDet-100K dataset compared to DenoDet V1, while reducing the
model complexity by half. The code is available at

uses small entry ports (30 mm) to exclude pigeons and reduce nuisance triggers.
Detector-guided cropping improves classification accuracy over raw-frame

Abstract: Large-scale high-quality 3D motion datasets with multi-person interactions
are crucial for data-driven models in autonomous driving to achieve
fine-grained pedestrian interaction understanding in dynamic urban
environments. However, existing datasets mostly rely on estimating 3D poses
from monocular RGB video frames, which suffer from occlusion and lack of
temporal continuity, thus resulting in unrealistic and low-quality human
motion. In this paper, we introduce Waymo-3DSkelMo, the first large-scale
dataset providing high-quality, temporally coherent 3D skeletal motions with
explicit interaction semantics, derived from the Waymo Perception dataset. Our
key insight is to utilize 3D human body shape and motion priors to enhance the
quality of the 3D pose sequences extracted from the raw LiDRA point clouds. The
dataset covers over 14,000 seconds across more than 800 real driving scenarios,
including rich interactions among an average of 27 agents per scene (with up to
250 agents in the largest scene). Furthermore, we establish 3D pose forecasting
benchmarks under varying pedestrian densities, and the results demonstrate its
value as a foundational resource for future research on fine-grained human
behavior understanding in complex urban environments. The dataset and code will

Conclusion: 研究贡献了首个大规模高质量路缘坡道检测数据集、基准和模型。

Abstract: Curb ramps are critical for urban accessibility, but robustly detecting them
in images remains an open problem due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality
datasets. While prior work has attempted to improve data availability with
crowdsourced or manually labeled data, these efforts often fall short in either
quality or scale. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a two-stage pipeline
called RampNet to scale curb ramp detection datasets and improve model
performance. In Stage 1, we generate a dataset of more than 210,000 annotated
Google Street View (GSV) panoramas by auto-translating government-provided curb
ramp location data to pixel coordinates in panoramic images. In Stage 2, we
train a curb ramp detection model (modified ConvNeXt V2) from the generated
dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance. To evaluate both stages of our
pipeline, we compare to manually labeled panoramas. Our generated dataset
achieves 94.0% precision and 92.5% recall, and our detection model reaches
0.9236 AP -- far exceeding prior work. Our work contributes the first
large-scale, high-quality curb ramp detection dataset, benchmark, and model.

Result: 在MP3D和Gibson数据集上达到SOTA性能，并在HM3D上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: GOAL通过生成流模型和LLM先验的结合，显著提升了目标导航任务的泛化性和性能。

Abstract: The Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) task challenges agents to locate a
specified object in an unseen environment by imagining unobserved regions of
the scene. Prior approaches rely on deterministic and discriminative models to
complete semantic maps, overlooking the inherent uncertainty in indoor layouts
and limiting their ability to generalize to unseen environments. In this work,
we propose GOAL, a generative flow-based framework that models the semantic
distribution of indoor environments by bridging observed regions with
LLM-enriched full-scene semantic maps. During training, spatial priors inferred
from large language models (LLMs) are encoded as two-dimensional Gaussian
fields and injected into target maps, distilling rich contextual knowledge into
the flow model and enabling more generalizable completions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GOAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on MP3D
and Gibson, and shows strong generalization in transfer settings to HM3D. Codes
and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/Badi-Li/GOAL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新视觉任务，同时预测高级动作语义和细粒度身体接触区域，并提出了PaIR-Net框架和PaIR数据集，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能同时建模动作语义及其空间上下文，需填补这一空白。

Method: 提出PaIR-Net框架，包含CPAM、PGCS和IIM三个模块，用于识别接触相关身体部分、像素级接触分割及全局关系整合。

Result: PaIR-Net显著优于基线方法，消融实验验证各模块有效性。

Conclusion: PaIR-Net和PaIR数据集为动作语义与空间上下文联合建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: People control their bodies to establish contact with the environment. To
comprehensively understand actions across diverse visual contexts, it is
essential to simultaneously consider \textbf{what} action is occurring and
\textbf{where} it is happening. Current methodologies, however, often
inadequately capture this duality, typically failing to jointly model both
action semantics and their spatial contextualization within scenes. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel vision task that simultaneously predicts
high-level action semantics and fine-grained body-part contact regions. Our
proposed framework, PaIR-Net, comprises three key components: the Contact Prior
Aware Module (CPAM) for identifying contact-relevant body parts, the
Prior-Guided Concat Segmenter (PGCS) for pixel-wise contact segmentation, and
the Interaction Inference Module (IIM) responsible for integrating global
interaction relationships. To facilitate this task, we present PaIR (Part-aware
Interaction Representation), a comprehensive dataset containing 13,979 images
that encompass 654 actions, 80 object categories, and 17 body parts.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates that PaIR-Net significantly outperforms
baseline approaches, while ablation studies confirm the efficacy of each
architectural component. The code and dataset will be released upon
publication.

*Jiateng Liu,Hengcan Shi,Feng Chen,Zhiwen Shao,Yaonan Wang,Jianfei Cai,Wenming Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Motion Prompt Tuning (MPT)的新方法，通过运动提示生成和组适配器设计，将大型预训练模型(LMs)适应于微表情识别(MER)，解决了现有方法难以捕捉细微面部运动的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别在医疗诊断、谎言检测等领域有广泛应用，但标注数据稀缺且需要专业知识，导致训练样本不足。现有大型预训练模型难以捕捉微表情的短暂和细微运动。

Method: 提出MPT方法，包括运动放大和高斯标记化的运动提示生成，以及插入组适配器以增强模型在MER领域的表现。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的MER数据集上的实验表明，MPT方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MPT方法通过运动提示生成和组适配器设计，有效提升了微表情识别的性能。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is crucial in the affective computing
field due to its wide application in medical diagnosis, lie detection, and
criminal investigation. Despite its significance, obtaining micro-expression
(ME) annotations is challenging due to the expertise required from
psychological professionals. Consequently, ME datasets often suffer from a
scarcity of training samples, severely constraining the learning of MER models.
While current large pre-training models (LMs) offer general and discriminative
representations, their direct application to MER is hindered by an inability to
capture transitory and subtle facial movements-essential elements for effective
MER. This paper introduces Motion Prompt Tuning (MPT) as a novel approach to
adapting LMs for MER, representing a pioneering method for subtle motion prompt
tuning. Particularly, we introduce motion prompt generation, including motion
magnification and Gaussian tokenization, to extract subtle motions as prompts
for LMs. Additionally, a group adapter is carefully designed and inserted into
the LM to enhance it in the target MER domain, facilitating a more nuanced
distinction of ME representation. Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted
on three widely used MER datasets demonstrate that our proposed MPT
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches and verifies its
effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的检索增强超分辨率（RASR）方法，通过自动检索高分辨率参考图像提升低质量输入图像的超分辨率效果，解决了传统RefSR依赖手动配对的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于参考的超分辨率（RefSR）方法依赖手动配对的参考图像，限制了实际应用。论文旨在通过自动检索参考图像提升实用性和灵活性。

Method: 提出RASR框架，结合语义参考检索器和基于扩散的RefSR生成器，自动检索语义相关的高分辨率参考图像并生成高质量结果。

Result: 在RASR-Flickr30数据集上，RASRNet相比SISR基线提升0.38 dB PSNR和-0.0131 LPIPS，生成更真实的纹理。

Conclusion: 检索增强是连接学术研究与实际应用的有效方向，RASR为RefSR的实用化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reference-based Super Resolution (RefSR) improves upon Single Image Super
Resolution (SISR) by leveraging high-quality reference images to enhance
texture fidelity and visual realism. However, a critical limitation of existing
RefSR approaches is their reliance on manually curated target-reference image
pairs, which severely constrains their practicality in real-world scenarios. To
overcome this, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Super Resolution (RASR), a new
and practical RefSR paradigm that automatically retrieves semantically relevant
high-resolution images from a reference database given only a low-quality
input. This enables scalable and flexible RefSR in realistic use cases, such as
enhancing mobile photos taken in environments like zoos or museums, where
category-specific reference data (e.g., animals, artworks) can be readily
collected or pre-curated. To facilitate research in this direction, we
construct RASR-Flickr30, the first benchmark dataset designed for RASR. Unlike
prior datasets with fixed target-reference pairs, RASR-Flickr30 provides
per-category reference databases to support open-world retrieval. We further
propose RASRNet, a strong baseline that combines a semantic reference retriever
with a diffusion-based RefSR generator. It retrieves relevant references based
on semantic similarity and employs a diffusion-based generator enhanced with
semantic conditioning. Experiments on RASR-Flickr30 demonstrate that RASRNet
consistently improves over SISR baselines, achieving +0.38 dB PSNR and -0.0131
LPIPS, while generating more realistic textures. These findings highlight
retrieval augmentation as a promising direction to bridge the gap between
academic RefSR research and real-world applicability.

Conclusion: HyperKD通过知识蒸馏有效填补了光谱域差距，为高光谱遥感中的基础模型应用提供了潜力。

Abstract: The proliferation of foundation models, pretrained on large-scale unlabeled
datasets, has emerged as an effective approach in creating adaptable and
reusable architectures that can be leveraged for various downstream tasks using
satellite observations. However, their direct application to hyperspectral
remote sensing remains challenging due to inherent spectral disparities and the
scarcity of available observations. In this work, we present HyperKD, a novel
knowledge distillation framework that enables transferring learned
representations from a teacher model into a student model for effective
development of a foundation model on hyperspectral images. Unlike typical
knowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a
simpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across
different types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building
upon a Masked Autoencoder, HyperKD distills knowledge from the Prithvi
foundational model into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery.
HyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by
introducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel
alignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function
tailored for hyperspectral images. HyperKD bridges the substantial spectral
domain gap, enabling the effective use of pretrained foundation models for
geospatial applications. Extensive experiments show that HyperKD significantly
improves representation learning in MAEs, leading to enhanced reconstruction
fidelity and more robust performance on downstream tasks such as land cover
classification, crop type identification, and soil organic carbon prediction,
underpinning the potential of knowledge distillation frameworks in remote
sensing analytics with hyperspectral imagery.

Motivation: 现有角色动画方法主要针对人类形象，难以泛化到游戏和娱乐行业常用的拟人角色，且只能生成静态背景视频，限制了视频的真实感。

Result: 实验证明Animate-X++在拟人角色动画和动态背景生成上具有优越性和有效性。

Conclusion: Animate-X++通过改进运动表示和多任务训练，显著提升了角色动画的通用性和真实感。

Abstract: Character image animation, which generates high-quality videos from a
reference image and target pose sequence, has seen significant progress in
recent years. However, most existing methods only apply to human figures, which
usually do not generalize well on anthropomorphic characters commonly used in
industries like gaming and entertainment. Furthermore, previous methods could
only generate videos with static backgrounds, which limits the realism of the
videos. For the first challenge, our in-depth analysis suggests to attribute
this limitation to their insufficient modeling of motion, which is unable to
comprehend the movement pattern of the driving video, thus imposing a pose
sequence rigidly onto the target character. To this end, this paper proposes
Animate-X++, a universal animation framework based on DiT for various character
types, including anthropomorphic characters. To enhance motion representation,
we introduce the Pose Indicator, which captures comprehensive motion pattern
from the driving video through both implicit and explicit manner. The former
leverages CLIP visual features of a driving video to extract its gist of
motion, like the overall movement pattern and temporal relations among motions,
while the latter strengthens the generalization of DiT by simulating possible
inputs in advance that may arise during inference. For the second challenge, we
introduce a multi-task training strategy that jointly trains the animation and
TI2V tasks. Combined with the proposed partial parameter training, this
approach achieves not only character animation but also text-driven background
dynamics, making the videos more realistic. Moreover, we introduce a new
Animated Anthropomorphic Benchmark (A2Bench) to evaluate the performance of
Animate-X++ on universal and widely applicable animation images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of Animate-X++.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型输入感知后门攻击方法IAG，用于操纵视觉语言模型（VLMs）的视觉定位行为，通过自适应触发器生成器实现攻击目标语义的嵌入，并在实验中验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）在视觉定位任务中表现优异，但其安全性问题，尤其是后门攻击，尚未充分研究。本文旨在探索并解决这一安全漏洞。

Method: 提出IAG方法，利用文本条件U-Net生成自适应触发器，将攻击目标的语义信息嵌入原始图像，并通过重构损失确保攻击的隐蔽性。同时，提出统一的攻击数据生成方法。

Result: 实验表明，IAG在InternVL-2.5-8B上的ASR@0.5超过65%，且在Ferret-7B和LlaVA-1.5-7B上也表现出色，对干净样本的准确性影响极小。

Conclusion: IAG是一种有效且隐蔽的后门攻击方法，具有鲁棒性和可迁移性，为VLMs的安全性研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant advancements in tasks
such as visual grounding, where they localize specific objects in images based
on natural language queries and images. However, security issues in visual
grounding tasks for VLMs remain underexplored, especially in the context of
backdoor attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel input-aware backdoor
attack method, IAG, designed to manipulate the grounding behavior of VLMs. This
attack forces the model to ground a specific target object in the input image,
regardless of the user's query. We propose an adaptive trigger generator that
embeds the semantic information of the attack target's description into the
original image using a text-conditional U-Net, thereby overcoming the
open-vocabulary attack challenge. To ensure the attack's stealthiness, we
utilize a reconstruction loss to minimize visual discrepancies between poisoned
and clean images. Additionally, we introduce a unified method for generating
attack data. IAG is evaluated theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its
feasibility and effectiveness. Notably, our ASR@0.5 on InternVL-2.5-8B reaches
over 65\% on various testing sets. IAG also shows promising potential on
manipulating Ferret-7B and LlaVA-1.5-7B with very little accuracy decrease on
clean samples. Extensive specific experiments, such as ablation study and
potential defense, also indicate the robustness and transferability of our
attack.

Conclusion: RelayFormer提供了一种高效且通用的视觉篡改定位解决方案，适用于不同模态和分辨率。

Abstract: Visual manipulation localization (VML) -- across both images and videos -- is
a crucial task in digital forensics that involves identifying tampered regions
in visual content. However, existing methods often lack cross-modal
generalization and struggle to handle high-resolution or long-duration inputs
efficiently.
  We propose RelayFormer, a unified and modular architecture for visual
manipulation localization across images and videos. By leveraging flexible
local units and a Global-Local Relay Attention (GLoRA) mechanism, it enables
scalable, resolution-agnostic processing with strong generalization. Our
framework integrates seamlessly with existing Transformer-based backbones, such
as ViT and SegFormer, via lightweight adaptation modules that require only
minimal architectural changes, ensuring compatibility without disrupting
pretrained representations.
  Furthermore, we design a lightweight, query-based mask decoder that supports
one-shot inference across video sequences with linear complexity. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art localization performance, setting a new baseline for scalable
and modality-agnostic VML. Code is available at:

Abstract: Different forms of customized 2D avatars are widely used in gaming
applications, virtual communication, education, and content creation. However,
existing approaches often fail to capture fine-grained facial expressions and
struggle to preserve identity across different expressions. We propose
GEN-AFFECT, a novel framework for personalized avatar generation that generates
expressive and identity-consistent avatars with a diverse set of facial
expressions. Our framework proposes conditioning a multimodal diffusion
transformer on an extracted identity-expression representation. This enables
identity preservation and representation of a wide range of facial expressions.
GEN-AFFECT additionally employs consistent attention at inference for
information sharing across the set of generated expressions, enabling the
generation process to maintain identity consistency over the array of generated
fine-grained expressions. GEN-AFFECT demonstrates superior performance compared
to previous state-of-the-art methods on the basis of the accuracy of the
generated expressions, the preservation of the identity and the consistency of
the target identity across an array of fine-grained facial expressions.

Abstract: Robust fitting of geometric models is a fundamental task in many computer
vision pipelines. Numerous innovations have been produced on the topic, from
improving the efficiency and accuracy of random sampling heuristics to
generating novel theoretical insights that underpin new approaches with
mathematical guarantees. However, one aspect of robust fitting that has
received little attention is energy efficiency. This performance metric has
become critical as high energy consumption is a growing concern for AI
adoption. In this paper, we explore energy-efficient robust fitting via the
neuromorphic computing paradigm. Specifically, we designed a novel spiking
neural network for robust fitting on real neuromorphic hardware, the Intel
Loihi 2. Enabling this are novel event-driven formulations of model estimation
that allow robust fitting to be implemented in the unique architecture of Loihi
2, and algorithmic strategies to alleviate the current limited precision and
instruction set of the hardware. Results show that our neuromorphic robust
fitting consumes only a fraction (15%) of the energy required to run the
established robust fitting algorithm on a standard CPU to equivalent accuracy.

Conclusion: CitySeg解决了数据分布不均和语义标签差异问题，显著提升了城市尺度点云分割的性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of city-scale point clouds is a critical technology for
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perception systems, enabling the classification
of 3D points without relying on any visual information to achieve comprehensive
3D understanding. However, existing models are frequently constrained by the
limited scale of 3D data and the domain gap between datasets, which lead to
reduced generalization capability. To address these challenges, we propose
CitySeg, a foundation model for city-scale point cloud semantic segmentation
that incorporates text modality to achieve open vocabulary segmentation and
zero-shot inference. Specifically, in order to mitigate the issue of
non-uniform data distribution across multiple domains, we customize the data
preprocessing rules, and propose a local-global cross-attention network to
enhance the perception capabilities of point networks in UAV scenarios. To
resolve semantic label discrepancies across datasets, we introduce a
hierarchical classification strategy. A hierarchical graph established
according to the data annotation rules consolidates the data labels, and the
graph encoder is used to model the hierarchical relationships between
categories. In addition, we propose a two-stage training strategy and employ
hinge loss to increase the feature separability of subcategories. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed CitySeg achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on nine closed-set benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing
approaches. Moreover, for the first time, CitySeg enables zero-shot
generalization in city-scale point cloud scenarios without relying on visual
information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中，深度伪造检测模型对未知样本表现不佳，但少量样本可用于改进性能，因此需从零样本任务转向少样本任务。

Method: 提出FTNet，仅需一个伪造样本作为参考，无需训练或参数更新，通过比较测试样本与已知样本的距离进行分类。

Result: 在29种生成模型的测试中，FTNet平均性能提升8.7%，达到新的最优水平。

Conclusion: FTNet为深度伪造检测提供了新视角，利用失败样本可显著提升性能。

Abstract: Recent deepfake detection studies often treat unseen sample detection as a
``zero-shot" task, training on images generated by known models but
generalizing to unknown ones. A key real-world challenge arises when a model
performs poorly on unknown samples, yet these samples remain available for
analysis. This highlights that it should be approached as a ``few-shot" task,
where effectively utilizing a small number of samples can lead to significant
improvement. Unlike typical few-shot tasks focused on semantic understanding,
deepfake detection prioritizes image realism, which closely mirrors real-world
distributions. In this work, we propose the Few-shot Training-free Network
(FTNet) for real-world few-shot deepfake detection. Simple yet effective, FTNet
differs from traditional methods that rely on large-scale known data for
training. Instead, FTNet uses only one fake samplefrom an evaluation set,
mimicking the scenario where new samples emerge in the real world and can be
gathered for use, without any training or parameter updates. During evaluation,
each test sample is compared to the known fake and real samples, and it is
classified based on the category of the nearest sample. We conduct a
comprehensive analysis of AI-generated images from 29 different generative
models and achieve a new SoTA performance, with an average improvement of 8.7\%
compared to existing methods. This work introduces a fresh perspective on
real-world deepfake detection: when the model struggles to generalize on a
few-shot sample, leveraging the failed samples leads to better performance.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在大角度面部情况下难以保持身份特征，主要由于缺乏有效的身份特征整合机制和针对大角度面部的数据集。

Method: 引入MoFE动态结合三种专家（身份、语义、细节）的特征，并设计数据处理流程（面部约束和身份一致性）构建LFA数据集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在LFA基准测试中显著优于现有方法，提升了面部相似度、FID和CLIP语义对齐。

Conclusion: MoFE和LFA数据集有效解决了大角度面部身份保持问题，为视频生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: Current video generation models struggle with identity preservation under
large facial angles, primarily facing two challenges: the difficulty in
exploring an effective mechanism to integrate identity features into DiT
structure, and the lack of targeted coverage of large facial angles in existing
open-source video datasets. To address these, we present two key innovations.
First, we introduce a Mixture of Facial Experts (MoFE) that dynamically
combines complementary cues from three specialized experts, each designed to
capture distinct but mutually reinforcing aspects of facial attributes. The
identity expert captures cross-pose identity-sensitive features, the semantic
expert extracts high-level visual semantxics, and the detail expert preserves
pixel-level features (e.g., skin texture, color gradients). Furthermore, to
mitigate dataset limitations, we have tailored a data processing pipeline
centered on two key aspects: Face Constraints and Identity Consistency. Face
Constraints ensure facial angle diversity and a high proportion of facial
regions, while Identity Consistency preserves coherent person-specific features
across temporal sequences, collectively addressing the scarcity of large facial
angles and identity-stable training data in existing datasets. Leveraging this
pipeline, we have curated and refined a Large Face Angles (LFA) Dataset from
existing open-source human video datasets, comprising 460K video clips with
annotated facial angles. Experimental results on the LFA benchmark demonstrate
that our method, empowered by the LFA dataset, significantly outperforms prior
SOTA methods in face similarity, face FID, and CLIP semantic alignment. The
code and dataset will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/rain152/LFA-Video-Generation.

Result: 实验证明该方法对多种图像生成器生成的AI图像检测有效。

Conclusion: 该方法为AI生成图像检测提供了通用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI generative models, the visual quality of
AI-generated images (AIIs) has become increasingly close to natural images,
which inevitably raises security concerns. Most AII detectors often employ the
conventional image classification pipeline with natural images and AIIs
(generated by a generative model), which can result in limited detection
performance for AIIs from unseen generative models. To solve this, we proposed
a universal AI-generated image detector from the perspective of anomaly
detection. Our discriminator does not need to access any AIIs and learn a
generalizable representation with unsupervised learning. Specifically, we use
the pre-trained CLIP encoder as the feature extractor and design a normalizing
flow-like unsupervised model. Instead of AIIs, proxy images, e.g., obtained by
applying a spectral modification operation on natural images, are used for
training. Our models are trained by minimizing the likelihood of proxy images,
optionally combined with maximizing the likelihood of natural images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on AIIs produced by
various image generators.

TL;DR: GazeLT是一种结合人类视觉注意力的方法，用于长尾疾病分类，通过整合和解构放射科医生的眼动模式，显著提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射科医生的眼动模式包含疾病相关信息，但现有深度学习框架未充分利用这种动态注意力变化，尤其是对长尾类别的关注。

Method: 提出GazeLT方法，通过整合和解构视觉搜索过程的时序特征，优化长尾疾病分类。

Result: 在NIH-CXR-LT和MIMIC-CXR-LT数据集上，GazeLT比最佳长尾损失方法提升4.1%，比视觉注意力基线提升21.7%。

Conclusion: GazeLT通过动态注意力建模，显著提升了长尾疾病分类性能，为自动化图像解读提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we present GazeLT, a human visual attention
integration-disintegration approach for long-tailed disease classification. A
radiologist's eye gaze has distinct patterns that capture both fine-grained and
coarser level disease related information. While interpreting an image, a
radiologist's attention varies throughout the duration; it is critical to
incorporate this into a deep learning framework to improve automated image
interpretation. Another important aspect of visual attention is that apart from
looking at major/obvious disease patterns, experts also look at
minor/incidental findings (few of these constituting long-tailed classes)
during the course of image interpretation. GazeLT harnesses the temporal aspect
of the visual search process, via an integration and disintegration mechanism,
to improve long-tailed disease classification. We show the efficacy of GazeLT
on two publicly available datasets for long-tailed disease classification,
namely the NIH-CXR-LT (n=89237) and the MIMIC-CXR-LT (n=111898) datasets.
GazeLT outperforms the best long-tailed loss by 4.1% and the visual
attention-based baseline by 21.7% in average accuracy metrics for these
datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/lordmoinak1/gazelt.

TL;DR: SkySplat是一种自监督框架，通过整合RPC模型到3DGS流程中，改进了稀疏卫星图像的三维重建效果，显著提升了速度和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法在稀疏卫星图像重建中存在与RPC模型不兼容和泛化能力不足的问题，SkySplat旨在解决这些限制。

Method: SkySplat结合RPC模型和自监督学习，利用RGB图像和相对高度监督，通过CSCM模块和多视图一致性策略优化重建。

Result: SkySplat比EOGS快86倍且更准确，在DFC19数据集上MAE从13.18米降至1.80米，并在MVS3D基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: SkySplat为稀疏卫星图像的三维重建提供了高效且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: Three-dimensional scene reconstruction from sparse-view satellite images is a
long-standing and challenging task. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its
variants have recently attracted attention for its high efficiency, existing
methods remain unsuitable for satellite images due to incompatibility with
rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) models and limited generalization
capability. Recent advances in generalizable 3DGS approaches show potential,
but they perform poorly on multi-temporal sparse satellite images due to
limited geometric constraints, transient objects, and radiometric
inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we propose SkySplat, a novel
self-supervised framework that integrates the RPC model into the generalizable
3DGS pipeline, enabling more effective use of sparse geometric cues for
improved reconstruction. SkySplat relies only on RGB images and
radiometric-robust relative height supervision, thereby eliminating the need
for ground-truth height maps. Key components include a Cross-Self Consistency
Module (CSCM), which mitigates transient object interference via
consistency-based masking, and a multi-view consistency aggregation strategy
that refines reconstruction results. Compared to per-scene optimization
methods, SkySplat achieves an 86 times speedup over EOGS with higher accuracy.
It also outperforms generalizable 3DGS baselines, reducing MAE from 13.18 m to
1.80 m on the DFC19 dataset significantly, and demonstrates strong
cross-dataset generalization on the MVS3D benchmark.

TL;DR: Video-EM框架通过模拟人类情景记忆，解决了Video-LLMs在长视频理解中的关键帧冗余和时空关系缺失问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Video-LLMs在长视频理解中因上下文窗口限制和关键帧冗余问题表现不佳，需改进方法以捕捉时空关系和场景连续性。

Method: Video-EM框架将关键帧建模为时序情景事件，结合链式思维（CoT）迭代筛选最小但信息丰富的记忆子集。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Video-EM性能提升4-9%，且使用更少帧数。

Conclusion: Video-EM通过情景记忆建模和CoT思维，显著提升了长视频理解的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) excel at general video understanding
but struggle with long-form videos due to context window limits. Consequently,
recent approaches focus on keyframe retrieval, condensing lengthy videos into a
small set of informative frames. Despite their practicality, these methods
simplify the problem to static text image matching, overlooking spatio temporal
relationships crucial for capturing scene transitions and contextual
continuity, and may yield redundant keyframes with limited information,
diluting salient cues essential for accurate video question answering. To
address these limitations, we introduce Video-EM, a training free framework
inspired by the principles of human episodic memory, designed to facilitate
robust and contextually grounded reasoning. Rather than treating keyframes as
isolated visual entities, Video-EM explicitly models them as temporally ordered
episodic events, capturing both spatial relationships and temporal dynamics
necessary for accurately reconstructing the underlying narrative. Furthermore,
the framework leverages chain of thought (CoT) thinking with LLMs to
iteratively identify a minimal yet highly informative subset of episodic
memories, enabling efficient and accurate question answering by Video-LLMs.
Extensive evaluations on the Video-MME, EgoSchema, HourVideo, and LVBench
benchmarks confirm the superiority of Video-EM, which achieves highly
competitive results with performance gains of 4-9 percent over respective
baselines while utilizing fewer frames.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SARE的新方法，通过测量图像与其标题引导重建之间的语义差异，来检测扩散模型生成的假图像。该方法在跨模型检测中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法在面对未见过的生成模型时性能下降，因为它们依赖模型特定的伪影。本文探索了假图像与标题高度相似的共性，提出了一种更通用的检测方法。

Method: 提出Semantic-Aware Reconstruction Error (SARE)，量化图像与标题引导重建之间的语义差异，利用这种差异作为检测特征。

Result: SARE在GenImage和CommunityForensics等基准测试中表现优于现有基线方法，展现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: SARE通过语义差异检测假图像，解决了现有方法对模型特定伪影的依赖问题，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Recently, diffusion-generated image detection has gained increasing
attention, as the rapid advancement of diffusion models has raised serious
concerns about their potential misuse. While existing detection methods have
achieved promising results, their performance often degrades significantly when
facing fake images from unseen, out-of-distribution (OOD) generative models,
since they primarily rely on model-specific artifacts. To address this
limitation, we explore a fundamental property commonly observed in fake images.
Motivated by the observation that fake images tend to exhibit higher similarity
to their captions than real images, we propose a novel representation, namely
Semantic-Aware Reconstruction Error (SARE), that measures the semantic
difference between an image and its caption-guided reconstruction. The
hypothesis behind SARE is that real images, whose captions often fail to fully
capture their complex visual content, may undergo noticeable semantic shifts
during the caption-guided reconstruction process. In contrast, fake images,
which closely align with their captions, show minimal semantic changes. By
quantifying these semantic shifts, SARE can be utilized as a discriminative
feature for robust detection across diverse generative models. We empirically
demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits strong generalization,
outperforming existing baselines on benchmarks including GenImage and
CommunityForensics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法在分子对接中忽视了几何信息，导致口袋定位和结合构象不准确。CWFBind旨在通过局部曲率特征和动态权重机制解决这一问题。

Method: CWFBind在特征提取阶段整合局部曲率描述符，嵌入度感知权重机制，并采用配体感知的动态半径策略和增强损失函数。

Result: CWFBind在多个对接基准测试中表现优异，实现了准确性与效率的平衡。

Conclusion: CWFBind通过几何特征和动态策略显著提升了分子对接的准确性，为理性药物设计提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the binding conformation of small-molecule ligands to
protein targets is a critical step in rational drug design. Although recent
deep learning-based docking surpasses traditional methods in speed and
accuracy, many approaches rely on graph representations and language
model-inspired encoders while neglecting critical geometric information,
resulting in inaccurate pocket localization and unrealistic binding
conformations. In this study, we introduce CWFBind, a weighted, fast, and
accurate docking method based on local curvature features. Specifically, we
integrate local curvature descriptors during the feature extraction phase to
enrich the geometric representation of both proteins and ligands, complementing
existing chemical, sequence, and structural features. Furthermore, we embed
degree-aware weighting mechanisms into the message passing process, enhancing
the model's ability to capture spatial structural distinctions and interaction
strengths. To address the class imbalance challenge in pocket prediction,
CWFBind employs a ligand-aware dynamic radius strategy alongside an enhanced
loss function, facilitating more precise identification of binding regions and
key residues. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that CWFBind
achieves competitive performance across multiple docking benchmarks, offering a
balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 手语是与听力障碍者沟通的重要媒介，但手语生成技术仍需探索。现有模型在分辨率和细节上存在不足，需改进。

Method: 结合Progressive Growing GAN（ProGAN）和Self-Attention GAN（SAGAN）的优势，开发了一种新的GAN变体，用于生成特征丰富、高分辨率的条件手语图像。

Result: 新模型在印度手语字母、数字和单词的图像生成上表现优异，IS和FID分别提升3.2和30.12。同时发布了包含129个单词的大型数据集。

Conclusion: 提出的GAN变体在手语图像生成中表现出色，为听力障碍者提供了更好的沟通工具，并公开了高质量数据集。

Abstract: Sign language, which contains hand movements, facial expressions and bodily
gestures, is a significant medium for communicating with hard-of-hearing
people. A well-trained sign language community communicates easily, but those
who don't know sign language face significant challenges. Recognition and
generation are basic communication methods between hearing and hard-of-hearing
individuals. Despite progress in recognition, sign language generation still
needs to be explored. The Progressive Growing of Generative Adversarial Network
(ProGAN) excels at producing high-quality images, while the Self-Attention
Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) generates feature-rich images at medium
resolutions. Balancing resolution and detail is crucial for sign language image
generation. We are developing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) variant
that combines both models to generate feature-rich, high-resolution, and
class-conditional sign language images. Our modified Attention-based model
generates high-quality images of Indian Sign Language letters, numbers, and
words, outperforming the traditional ProGAN in Inception Score (IS) and
Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), with improvements of 3.2 and 30.12,
respectively. Additionally, we are publishing a large dataset incorporating
high-quality images of Indian Sign Language alphabets, numbers, and 129 words.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究并量化了单目标跟踪（SOT）中的相似物体干扰（SOI），提出通过外部认知指导（如自然语言）提升跟踪性能，并构建了首个语义认知指导基准SOIBench。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相似物体干扰（SOI）是单目标跟踪（SOT）中一个长期被忽视但关键的性能瓶颈，本文旨在通过量化分析和外部认知指导解决这一问题。

Method: 通过在线干扰掩蔽（OIM）实验量化SOI影响，构建SOIBench基准，并利用大规模视觉语言模型（VLM）作为外部认知引擎。

Result: 消除干扰源显著提升跟踪性能（AUC增益达4.35），而现有视觉语言跟踪方法在SOIBench上表现不佳（AUC变化-0.26至+0.71），提出的VLM方法则实现显著改进（AUC增益达0.93）。

Conclusion: SOIBench为语义认知跟踪研究提供了标准化平台，VLM方法展示了外部认知指导的潜力，为跟踪领域带来新见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation and
quantification of Similar Object Interference (SOI), a long-overlooked yet
critical bottleneck in Single Object Tracking (SOT). Through controlled Online
Interference Masking (OIM) experiments, we quantitatively demonstrate that
eliminating interference sources leads to substantial performance improvements
(AUC gains up to 4.35) across all SOTA trackers, directly validating SOI as a
primary constraint for robust tracking and highlighting the feasibility of
external cognitive guidance. Building upon these insights, we adopt natural
language as a practical form of external guidance, and construct SOIBench-the
first semantic cognitive guidance benchmark specifically targeting SOI
challenges. It automatically mines SOI frames through multi-tracker collective
judgment and introduces a multi-level annotation protocol to generate precise
semantic guidance texts. Systematic evaluation on SOIBench reveals a striking
finding: existing vision-language tracking (VLT) methods fail to effectively
exploit semantic cognitive guidance, achieving only marginal improvements or
even performance degradation (AUC changes of -0.26 to +0.71). In contrast, we
propose a novel paradigm employing large-scale vision-language models (VLM) as
external cognitive engines that can be seamlessly integrated into arbitrary RGB
trackers. This approach demonstrates substantial improvements under semantic
cognitive guidance (AUC gains up to 0.93), representing a significant
advancement over existing VLT methods. We hope SOIBench will serve as a
standardized evaluation platform to advance semantic cognitive tracking
research and contribute new insights to the tracking research community.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SDT的新型视觉Transformer，通过上下文感知门控机制（CAG）实现数据依赖的空间衰减，显著提升了空间注意力性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉Transformer缺乏显式的空间归纳偏置，导致在空间结构化任务中表现不佳。本文受大型语言模型中内容感知门控机制的启发，旨在将数据依赖的空间衰减引入2D视觉Transformer。

Method: 提出SDT模型，采用CAG机制动态生成数据依赖的空间衰减，结合曼哈顿距离的空间先验与学习到的内容表示。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K分类和生成任务中，SDT表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 数据依赖的空间衰减为视觉Transformer的空间注意力提供了新范式。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision, yet their
self-attention mechanism lacks explicit spatial inductive biases, leading to
suboptimal performance on spatially-structured tasks. Existing approaches
introduce data-independent spatial decay based on fixed distance metrics,
applying uniform attention weighting regardless of image content and limiting
adaptability to diverse visual scenarios. Inspired by recent advances in large
language models where content-aware gating mechanisms (e.g., GLA, HGRN2, FOX)
significantly outperform static alternatives, we present the first successful
adaptation of data-dependent spatial decay to 2D vision transformers. We
introduce \textbf{Spatial Decay Transformer (SDT)}, featuring a novel
Context-Aware Gating (CAG) mechanism that generates dynamic, data-dependent
decay for patch interactions. Our approach learns to modulate spatial attention
based on both content relevance and spatial proximity. We address the
fundamental challenge of 1D-to-2D adaptation through a unified spatial-content
fusion framework that integrates manhattan distance-based spatial priors with
learned content representations. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K
classification and generation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. Our work establishes data-dependent spatial decay as a new
paradigm for enhancing spatial attention in vision transformers.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为COME的通用协作异构专家混合框架，用于解决超声图像分析中多数据集训练的挑战，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单数据集训练在新数据分布下表现不佳，尤其是在超声图像分析中，由于数据有限、声学阴影和斑点噪声等问题，亟需构建一个通用的多异构数据集框架。

Method: COME通过建立双结构-语义共享专家，创建通用表示空间，并与源特定专家协作，提取判别性特征。

Result: 在三种评估模式下（单数据集、器官内和器官间集成数据集），COME显著优于现有方法，平均AP提升明显。

Conclusion: COME通过利用跨数据集经验分布和提供通用超声先验，实现了鲁棒的泛化能力，适用于小批量或未见数据场景。

Abstract: Conventional single-dataset training often fails with new data distributions,
especially in ultrasound (US) image analysis due to limited data, acoustic
shadows, and speckle noise. Therefore, constructing a universal framework for
multi-heterogeneous US datasets is imperative. However, a key challenge arises:
how to effectively mitigate inter-dataset interference while preserving
dataset-specific discriminative features for robust downstream task? Previous
approaches utilize either a single source-specific decoder or a domain
adaptation strategy, but these methods experienced a decline in performance
when applied to other domains. Considering this, we propose a Universal
Collaborative Mixture of Heterogeneous Source-Specific Experts (COME).
Specifically, COME establishes dual structure-semantic shared experts that
create a universal representation space and then collaborate with
source-specific experts to extract discriminative features through providing
complementary features. This design enables robust generalization by leveraging
cross-datasets experience distributions and providing universal US priors for
small-batch or unseen data scenarios. Extensive experiments under three
evaluation modes (single-dataset, intra-organ, and inter-organ integration
datasets) demonstrate COME's superiority, achieving significant mean AP
improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Our project is available at:

Result: MEUNet在重建精度和推理速度上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: AKCS和MACA的结合有效解决了测量非相干性和表示学习问题，MEUNet表现出色。

Abstract: Deep networks have achieved remarkable success in image compressed sensing
(CS) task, namely reconstructing a high-fidelity image from its compressed
measurement. However, existing works are deficient inincoherent compressed
measurement at sensing phase and implicit measurement representations at
reconstruction phase, limiting the overall performance. In this work, we answer
two questions: 1) how to improve the measurement incoherence for decreasing the
ill-posedness; 2) how to learn informative representations from measurements.
To this end, we propose a novel asymmetric Kronecker CS (AKCS) model and
theoretically present its better incoherence than previous Kronecker CS with
minimal complexity increase. Moreover, we reveal that the unfolding networks'
superiority over non-unfolding ones result from sufficient gradient descents,
called explicit measurement representations. We propose a measurement-aware
cross attention (MACA) mechanism to learn implicit measurement representations.
We integrate AKCS and MACA into widely-used unfolding architecture to get a
measurement-enhanced unfolding network (MEUNet). Extensive experiences
demonstrate that our MEUNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstruction accuracy and inference speed.

Motivation: 现实世界图像数据存在稀有场景覆盖不足和噪声问题，而GPT-4o生成的合成数据能弥补这些缺陷。

Method: 通过GPT-4o生成180K规模的合成数据集Echo-4o-Image，并基于此微调Bagel模型，同时提出新的评估基准GenEval++和Imagine-Bench。

Result: Echo-4o在标准基准测试中表现优异，且数据集对其他基础模型也有性能提升。

Conclusion: 合成图像数据能有效填补现实数据的盲点，提升模型性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Recently, GPT-4o has garnered significant attention for its strong
performance in image generation, yet open-source models still lag behind.
Several studies have explored distilling image data from GPT-4o to enhance
open-source models, achieving notable progress. However, a key question
remains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural
source of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data?
In this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they
can complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy
or multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries.
Second, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often
contains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text
descriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds
and long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image
alignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale
synthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image
data to address blind spots in real-world coverage. Using this dataset, we
fine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o.
In addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and
challenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which
increases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and
Imagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and
generation of imaginative content. Echo-4o demonstrates strong performance
across standard benchmarks. Moreover, applying Echo-4o-Image to other
foundation models (e.g., OmniGen2, BLIP3-o) yields consistent performance gains
across multiple metrics, highlighting the datasets strong transferability.

Conclusion: COXNet在复杂环境中表现出鲁棒性，为RGBT微小目标检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in multimodal Red-Green-Blue-Thermal (RGBT) imagery is
a critical challenge in computer vision, particularly in surveillance, search
and rescue, and autonomous navigation. Drone-based scenarios exacerbate these
challenges due to spatial misalignment, low-light conditions, occlusion, and
cluttered backgrounds. Current methods struggle to leverage the complementary
information between visible and thermal modalities effectively. We propose
COXNet, a novel framework for RGBT tiny object detection, addressing these
issues through three core innovations: i) the Cross-Layer Fusion Module, fusing
high-level visible and low-level thermal features for enhanced semantic and
spatial accuracy; ii) the Dynamic Alignment and Scale Refinement module,
correcting cross-modal spatial misalignments and preserving multi-scale
features; and iii) an optimized label assignment strategy using the GeoShape
Similarity Measure for better localization. COXNet achieves a 3.32\% mAP$_{50}$
improvement on the RGBTDronePerson dataset over state-of-the-art methods,
demonstrating its effectiveness for robust detection in complex environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着非对称多相机系统（如长焦-广角相机）的兴起，传统立体匹配算法假设的视觉对称性被打破，导致匹配困难。

Method: 提出两阶段迭代体积融合网络，首先通过聚合拼接体积优化相关体积，随后融合两种体积以增强细节。

Result: 该方法在非对称场景下表现优异，并能有效应对分辨率和颜色退化问题。

Conclusion: 实验证明，IVF-AStereo在非对称立体匹配中具有显著效果。

Abstract: Stereo matching is vital in 3D computer vision, with most algorithms assuming
symmetric visual properties between binocular visions. However, the rise of
asymmetric multi-camera systems (e.g., tele-wide cameras) challenges this
assumption and complicates stereo matching. Visual asymmetry disrupts stereo
matching by affecting the crucial cost volume computation. To address this, we
explore the matching cost distribution of two established cost volume
construction methods in asymmetric stereo. We find that each cost volume
experiences distinct information distortion, indicating that both should be
comprehensively utilized to solve the issue. Based on this, we propose the
two-phase Iterative Volume Fusion network for Asymmetric Stereo matching
(IVF-AStereo). Initially, the aggregated concatenation volume refines the
correlation volume. Subsequently, both volumes are fused to enhance fine
details. Our method excels in asymmetric scenarios and shows robust performance
against significant visual asymmetry. Extensive comparative experiments on
benchmark datasets, along with ablation studies, confirm the effectiveness of
our approach in asymmetric stereo with resolution and color degradation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖结构化输入（如语义标注或环境地图），而GoViG仅利用原始视觉数据，提高了对未知和非结构化环境的适应性。

Method: 任务分解为视觉预测（预测中间视觉状态）和指令生成（基于观察和预测生成连贯指令），通过自回归多模态大语言模型实现。

Conclusion: GoViG通过视觉预测和指令生成的结合，实现了高精度和适应性，为导航指令生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce Goal-Conditioned Visual Navigation Instruction Generation
(GoViG), a new task that aims to autonomously generate precise and contextually
coherent navigation instructions solely from egocentric visual observations of
initial and goal states. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on structured
inputs such as semantic annotations or environmental maps, GoViG exclusively
leverages raw egocentric visual data, substantially improving its adaptability
to unseen and unstructured environments. Our method addresses this task by
decomposing it into two interconnected subtasks: (1) visual forecasting, which
predicts intermediate visual states bridging the initial and goal views; and
(2) instruction generation, which synthesizes linguistically coherent
instructions grounded in both observed and anticipated visuals. These subtasks
are integrated within an autoregressive multimodal large language model trained
with tailored objectives to ensure spatial accuracy and linguistic clarity.
Furthermore, we introduce two complementary multimodal reasoning strategies,
one-pass and interleaved reasoning, to mimic incremental human cognitive
processes during navigation. To evaluate our method, we propose the R2R-Goal
dataset, combining diverse synthetic and real-world trajectories. Empirical
results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior BLEU-4 and CIDEr scores along with robust cross-domain

Abstract: In this paper, we address a key scientific problem in machine learning: Given
a training set for an image classification task, can we train a generative
model on this dataset to enhance the classification performance? (i.e.,
closed-set generative data augmentation). We start by exploring the
distinctions and similarities between real images and closed-set synthetic
images generated by advanced generative models. Through extensive experiments,
we offer systematic insights into the effective use of closed-set synthetic
data for augmentation. Notably, we empirically determine the equivalent scale
of synthetic images needed for augmentation. In addition, we also show
quantitative equivalence between the real data augmentation and open-set
generative augmentation (generative models trained using data beyond the given
training set). While it aligns with the common intuition that real images are
generally preferred, our empirical formulation also offers a guideline to
quantify the increased scale of synthetic data augmentation required to achieve
comparable image classification performance. Our results on natural and medical
image datasets further illustrate how this effect varies with the baseline
training set size and the amount of synthetic data incorporated.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于2D虹膜图像拓扑不变量的生物识别方法，通过数字同调理论表示虹膜纹理，并评估分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索一种紧凑、可解释且准确的虹膜识别方法，以替代深度学习，适用于需要可解释性或数据有限的场景。

Method: 将归一化虹膜图像划分为子区域，计算每个子区域的Betti0、Betti1及其比率，形成特征矩阵，结合逻辑回归、KNN和SVM进行分类，并与CNN进行比较。

Result: 逻辑回归的准确率为97.78% ± 0.82%，优于CNN（96.44% ± 1.32%）和其他基于特征的模型，拓扑特征表现出高准确性和低方差。

Conclusion: 这是首次将数字同调理论的拓扑不变量用于虹膜识别，该方法为深度学习提供了一种紧凑、可解释且高效的替代方案，适用于安全关键领域和其他应用场景。

Abstract: Objective - This study presents a biometric identification method based on
topological invariants from 2D iris images, representing iris texture via
formally defined digital homology and evaluating classification performance.
  Methods - Each normalized iris image (48x482 pixels) is divided into grids
(e.g., 6x54 or 3x27). For each subregion, we compute Betti0, Betti1, and their
ratio using a recent algorithm for homology groups in 2D digital images. The
resulting invariants form a feature matrix used with logistic regression, KNN,
and SVM (with PCA and 100 randomized repetitions). A convolutional neural
network (CNN) is trained on raw images for comparison.
  Results - Logistic regression achieved 97.78 +/- 0.82% accuracy,
outperforming CNN (96.44 +/- 1.32%) and other feature-based models. The
topological features showed high accuracy with low variance.
  Conclusion - This is the first use of topological invariants from formal
digital homology for iris recognition. The method offers a compact,
interpretable, and accurate alternative to deep learning, useful when
explainability or limited data is important. Beyond iris recognition, it can
apply to other biometrics, medical imaging, materials science, remote sensing,
and interpretable AI. It runs efficiently on CPU-only systems and produces
robust, explainable features valuable for security-critical domains.

TL;DR: WeatherPrompt提出了一种多模态学习范式，通过融合图像嵌入与文本上下文建立天气不变的表示，解决了无人机视觉地理定位在天气扰动下的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在天气扰动（如雨、雾）下性能显著下降，主要受限于对有限天气类别的依赖以及场景-天气特征解缠不足。

Method: 提出了Training-free Weather Reasoning机制和多模态动态门控框架，通过文本嵌入自适应重加权和融合视觉特征，并结合跨模态目标优化。

Result: 在多种天气条件下，WeatherPrompt的召回率优于现有方法，夜间条件下Recall@1提升13.37%，雾雪条件下提升18.69%。

Conclusion: WeatherPrompt通过多模态融合和动态门控机制，显著提升了无人机在复杂天气条件下的地理定位性能。

Abstract: Visual geo-localization for drones faces critical degradation under weather
perturbations, \eg, rain and fog, where existing methods struggle with two
inherent limitations: 1) Heavy reliance on limited weather categories that
constrain generalization, and 2) Suboptimal disentanglement of entangled
scene-weather features through pseudo weather categories. We present
WeatherPrompt, a multi-modality learning paradigm that establishes
weather-invariant representations through fusing the image embedding with the
text context. Our framework introduces two key contributions: First, a
Training-free Weather Reasoning mechanism that employs off-the-shelf large
multi-modality models to synthesize multi-weather textual descriptions through
human-like reasoning. It improves the scalability to unseen or complex weather,
and could reflect different weather strength. Second, to better disentangle the
scene and weather feature, we propose a multi-modality framework with the
dynamic gating mechanism driven by the text embedding to adaptively reweight
and fuse visual features across modalities. The framework is further optimized
by the cross-modal objectives, including image-text contrastive learning and
image-text matching, which maps the same scene with different weather
conditions closer in the respresentation space. Extensive experiments validate
that, under diverse weather conditions, our method achieves competitive recall
rates compared to state-of-the-art drone geo-localization methods. Notably, it
improves Recall@1 by +13.37\% under night conditions and by 18.69\% under fog
and snow conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多曝光校正方法在处理单一曝光图像时，难以应对由多样光照条件、拍摄环境和天气因素引起的类内变异性。

Method: 提出了WEC-DG方法，包括曝光一致性对齐模块（ECAM）和曝光恢复与细节重建模块（EDRM），利用小波变换实现光-细节解耦。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有算法，性能提升明显。

Conclusion: WEC-DG方法在复杂成像条件下表现出色，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multi-exposure correction technology is essential for restoring images
affected by insufficient or excessive lighting, enhancing the visual experience
by improving brightness, contrast, and detail richness. However, current
multi-exposure correction methods often encounter challenges in addressing
intra-class variability caused by diverse lighting conditions, shooting
environments, and weather factors, particularly when processing images captured
at a single exposure level. To enhance the adaptability of these models under
complex imaging conditions, this paper proposes a Wavelet-based Exposure
Correction method with Degradation Guidance (WEC-DG). Specifically, we
introduce a degradation descriptor within the Exposure Consistency Alignment
Module (ECAM) at both ends of the processing pipeline to ensure exposure
consistency and achieve final alignment. This mechanism effectively addresses
miscorrected exposure anomalies caused by existing methods' failure to
recognize 'blurred' exposure degradation. Additionally, we investigate the
light-detail decoupling properties of the wavelet transform to design the
Exposure Restoration and Detail Reconstruction Module (EDRM), which processes
low-frequency information related to exposure enhancement before utilizing
high-frequency information as a prior guide for reconstructing spatial domain
details. This serial processing strategy guarantees precise light correction
and enhances detail recovery. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple
public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing
algorithms, achieving significant performance improvements and validating its
effectiveness and practical applicability.

Motivation: 现有放射学报告生成模型在临床效果和可解释性方面表现不佳，尤其是对病变属性的描述和结果的可信度不足。

Method: 提出CoD框架，通过诊断对话生成问答对提取关键发现，并利用大语言模型生成准确报告；设计诊断基础模块和病变基础模块增强可解释性和定位能力；采用全监督学习策略利用多种标注数据。

Result: 开发了包含问答对和病变框的全标注数据集，评估工具验证了报告在病变位置和严重性描述的准确性；实验表明CoD在两项基准测试中优于专业和通用模型，并展示了良好的可解释性。

Conclusion: CoD框架显著提升了放射学报告生成的临床准确性和可解释性，为放射科医生提供了高效且可信的工具。

Abstract: Despite the progress of radiology report generation (RRG), existing works
face two challenges: 1) The performances in clinical efficacy are
unsatisfactory, especially for lesion attributes description; 2) the generated
text lacks explainability, making it difficult for radiologists to trust the
results. To address the challenges, we focus on a trustworthy RRG model, which
not only generates accurate descriptions of abnormalities, but also provides
basis of its predictions. To this end, we propose a framework named chain of
diagnosis (CoD), which maintains a chain of diagnostic process for clinically
accurate and explainable RRG. It first generates question-answer (QA) pairs via
diagnostic conversation to extract key findings, then prompts a large language
model with QA diagnoses for accurate generation. To enhance explainability, a
diagnosis grounding module is designed to match QA diagnoses and generated
sentences, where the diagnoses act as a reference. Moreover, a lesion grounding
module is designed to locate abnormalities in the image, further improving the
working efficiency of radiologists. To facilitate label-efficient training, we
propose an omni-supervised learning strategy with clinical consistency to
leverage various types of annotations from different datasets. Our efforts lead
to 1) an omni-labeled RRG dataset with QA pairs and lesion boxes; 2) a
evaluation tool for assessing the accuracy of reports in describing lesion
location and severity; 3) extensive experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness of CoD, where it outperforms both specialist and generalist
models consistently on two RRG benchmarks and shows promising explainability by
accurately grounding generated sentences to QA diagnoses and images.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的双递归反馈（DRF）系统，用于改进可控文本到图像（T2I）扩散模型的空间和外观控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控T2I模型在保留空间结构和捕捉细粒度条件（如物体姿态和场景布局）方面表现不佳。

Method: 通过外观反馈和生成反馈的双递归机制，优化中间潜在表示，以更好地反映外观信息和用户意图。

Result: 实验表明，DRF能生成高质量、语义一致且结构一致的图像，支持类不变的结构-外观融合（如将人类动作转移到老虎形态）。

Conclusion: DRF系统有效解决了现有模型的局限性，为可控T2I生成提供了更精细的控制能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in controllable text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models,
such as Ctrl-X and FreeControl, have demonstrated robust spatial and appearance
control without requiring auxiliary module training. However, these models
often struggle to accurately preserve spatial structures and fail to capture
fine-grained conditions related to object poses and scene layouts. To address
these challenges, we propose a training-free Dual Recursive Feedback (DRF)
system that properly reflects control conditions in controllable T2I models.
The proposed DRF consists of appearance feedback and generation feedback that
recursively refines the intermediate latents to better reflect the given
appearance information and the user's intent. This dual-update mechanism guides
latent representations toward reliable manifolds, effectively integrating
structural and appearance attributes. Our approach enables fine-grained
generation even between class-invariant structure-appearance fusion, such as
transferring human motion onto a tiger's form. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the efficacy of our method in producing high-quality, semantically
coherent, and structurally consistent image generations. Our source code is
available at https://github.com/jwonkm/DRF.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动化数据构建方法SHALE，用于评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）中的幻觉问题，包括忠实性和事实性幻觉，并通过实验揭示了模型对语义扰动的敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）发展迅速，但仍存在幻觉问题，即生成与输入或世界知识不一致的内容。现有研究在评估忠实性幻觉时缺乏细粒度分析，且依赖昂贵的人工标注或公共数据集，限制了可扩展性和数据泄露风险。

Method: 提出自动化数据构建管道，生成可扩展、可控且多样化的评估数据；设计分层幻觉诱导框架，通过输入扰动模拟真实噪声场景；构建SHALE基准，涵盖12个视觉感知方面和6个知识领域，包含30K图像-指令对。

Result: 实验覆盖20多个主流LVLM，发现显著的事实性幻觉问题，并显示模型对语义扰动高度敏感。

Conclusion: SHALE基准为LVLM的幻觉问题提供了细粒度评估工具，揭示了模型在噪声环境下的脆弱性，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still suffer
from hallucinations, i.e., generating content inconsistent with input or
established world knowledge, which correspond to faithfulness and factuality
hallucinations, respectively. Prior studies primarily evaluate faithfulness
hallucination at a coarse level (e.g., object-level) and lack fine-grained
analysis. Additionally, existing benchmarks rely on costly manual curation or
reused public datasets, raising concerns about scalability and data leakage. To
address these limitations, we propose an automated data construction pipeline
that produces scalable, controllable, and diverse evaluation data. We also
design a hierarchical hallucination induction framework with input
perturbations to simulate realistic noisy scenarios. Integrating these designs,
we construct SHALE, a Scalable HALlucination Evaluation benchmark designed to
assess both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations via a fine-grained
hallucination categorization scheme. SHALE comprises over 30K image-instruction
pairs spanning 12 representative visual perception aspects for faithfulness and
6 knowledge domains for factuality, considering both clean and noisy scenarios.
Extensive experiments on over 20 mainstream LVLMs reveal significant factuality
hallucinations and high sensitivity to semantic perturbations.

Abstract: This paper introduces BAAS, a new Extended Object Tracking (EOT) and
fusion-based label annotation framework for radar detections in autonomous

eventually fusion methods to provide veritable and precise object trajectories
along with shape estimation to provide annotation labels on the detection level
under various supervision levels. Simultaneously, the framework provides
evaluation of tracking performance and label annotation. If manually labeled
data is available, each processing module can be analyzed independently or
combined with other modules to enable closed-loop continuous improvements. The
framework performance is evaluated in a challenging urban real-world scenario
in terms of tracking performance and the label annotation errors. We
demonstrate the functionality of the proposed approach for varying dynamic
objects and class types

Motivation: IDH突变状态是胶质瘤预后的重要生物标志物，但现有预测方法受限于功能MRI的低可用性和噪声。结构和形态连接组提供了一种非侵入性替代方案，但现有方法常忽略大脑的层次结构和多尺度交互。

Method: 提出Hi-SMGNN框架，整合区域到模块层次的结构和形态连接组，包括多模态交互模块（Siamese网络和跨模态注意力）、多尺度特征融合机制和个性化模块划分策略。

Conclusion: Hi-SMGNN通过分层和多尺度方法，显著提升了IDH突变预测的性能，同时增强了个体特异性和可解释性。

Abstract: Isocitrate DeHydrogenase (IDH) mutation status is a crucial biomarker for
glioma prognosis. However, current prediction methods are limited by the low
availability and noise of functional MRI. Structural and morphological
connectomes offer a non-invasive alternative, yet existing approaches often
ignore the brain's hierarchical organisation and multiscale interactions. To
address this, we propose Hi-SMGNN, a hierarchical framework that integrates
structural and morphological connectomes from regional to modular levels. It
features a multimodal interaction module with a Siamese network and cross-modal
attention, a multiscale feature fusion mechanism for reducing redundancy, and a
personalised modular partitioning strategy to enhance individual specificity
and interpretability. Experiments on the UCSF-PDGM dataset demonstrate that
Hi-SMGNN outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art models, showing improved
robustness and effectiveness in IDH mutation prediction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有头像生成方法在实时外观编辑方面的挑战，尤其是几何与全局外观的隐式表示和纠缠建模问题。

Method: 采用表面高斯模型绑定FLAME网格，利用解耦纹理图像捕捉全局外观；体积高斯模型提升非朗伯区域重建质量；提出网格感知的高斯UV映射方法。

Conclusion: SVG-Head为高保真且可编辑的头像生成提供了有效解决方案，推动了AR/VR应用的发展。

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity and editable head avatars is a pivotal challenge in
computer vision and graphics, boosting many AR/VR applications. While recent
advancements have achieved photorealistic renderings and plausible animation,
head editing, especially real-time appearance editing, remains challenging due
to the implicit representation and entangled modeling of the geometry and
global appearance. To address this, we propose Surface-Volumetric Gaussian Head
Avatar (SVG-Head), a novel hybrid representation that explicitly models the
geometry with 3D Gaussians bound on a FLAME mesh and leverages disentangled
texture images to capture the global appearance. Technically, it contains two
types of Gaussians, in which surface Gaussians explicitly model the appearance
of head avatars using learnable texture images, facilitating real-time texture
editing, while volumetric Gaussians enhance the reconstruction quality of
non-Lambertian regions (e.g., lips and hair). To model the correspondence
between 3D world and texture space, we provide a mesh-aware Gaussian UV mapping
method, which leverages UV coordinates given by the FLAME mesh to obtain sharp
texture images and real-time rendering speed. A hierarchical optimization
strategy is further designed to pursue the optimal performance in both
reconstruction quality and editing flexibility. Experiments on the NeRSemble
dataset show that SVG-Head not only generates high-fidelity rendering results,
but also is the first method to obtain explicit texture images for Gaussian
head avatars and support real-time appearance editing.

TL;DR: 论文提出FaME方法，通过评估模型生成的低质量图像并利用其采样轨迹作为负引导，提升生成图像的感知质量，同时不影响FID分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在类到图像生成中虽FID表现优异，但部分类别图像质量低或失真，因FID仅评估全局分布对齐而忽略单样本感知质量。CFG技术虽提升指标但可能引入分布偏移和视觉伪影。

Method: 提出FaME方法，使用图像质量评估模型识别低质量生成图像并存储其采样轨迹，作为负引导以避开低质量区域。

Result: 在ImageNet上实验显示，FaME能一致提升视觉质量且不影响FID，并有望扩展至文本到图像生成。

Conclusion: FaME是一种无需训练且推理高效的方法，能有效提升扩散模型生成图像的感知质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in class-to-image
generation. However, we observe that despite impressive FID scores,
state-of-the-art models often generate distorted or low-quality images,
especially in certain classes. This gap arises because FID evaluates global
distribution alignment, while ignoring the perceptual quality of individual
samples. We further examine the role of CFG, a common technique used to enhance
generation quality. While effective in improving metrics and suppressing
outliers, CFG can introduce distribution shift and visual artifacts due to its
misalignment with both training objectives and user expectations. In this work,
we propose FaME, a training-free and inference-efficient method for improving
perceptual quality. FaME uses an image quality assessment model to identify
low-quality generations and stores their sampling trajectories. These failure
modes are then used as negative guidance to steer future sampling away from
poor-quality regions. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that FaME brings
consistent improvements in visual quality without compromising FID. FaME also
shows the potential to be extended to improve text-to-image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纯相机方法在自动驾驶的BEV地图分割任务中表现不如LiDAR-Camera融合方法，现有知识蒸馏方法通过模仿教师模型架构来扩大学生模型，导致推理成本增加。

Method: 提出BridgeTA框架，利用轻量级TA网络结合教师和学生的BEV表示，创建共享潜在空间，并通过Young不等式推导蒸馏损失，分解为教师-TA和TA-学生双路径。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，该方法比纯相机基线提高了4.2% mIoU，优于其他最先进的KD方法（提升高达45%）。

Conclusion: BridgeTA框架通过TA网络有效缩小了表示差距，同时保持了低成本，为纯相机方法提供了更优的性能。

Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) map segmentation is one of the most important and
challenging tasks in autonomous driving. Camera-only approaches have drawn
attention as cost-effective alternatives to LiDAR, but they still fall behind
LiDAR-Camera (LC) fusion-based methods. Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been
explored to narrow this gap, but existing methods mainly enlarge the student
model by mimicking the teacher's architecture, leading to higher inference
cost. To address this issue, we introduce BridgeTA, a cost-effective
distillation framework to bridge the representation gap between LC fusion and
Camera-only models through a Teacher Assistant (TA) network while keeping the
student's architecture and inference cost unchanged. A lightweight TA network
combines the BEV representations of the teacher and student, creating a shared
latent space that serves as an intermediate representation. To ground the
framework theoretically, we derive a distillation loss using Young's
Inequality, which decomposes the direct teacher-student distillation path into
teacher-TA and TA-student dual paths, stabilizing optimization and
strengthening knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on the challenging
nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving an
improvement of 4.2% mIoU over the Camera-only baseline, up to 45% higher than
the improvement of other state-of-the-art KD methods.

Result: 在CT-RATE测试集上PSNR提升12.96 dB，辐射暴露减少8倍，性能与3D U-Net相当，并能适应新CBCT扫描仪。

Conclusion: MInDI-3D在临床评估中表现优异，适用于患者定位并保留肿瘤边界。

Abstract: We present MInDI-3D (Medical Inversion by Direct Iteration in 3D), the first
3D conditional diffusion-based model for real-world sparse-view Cone Beam
Computed Tomography (CBCT) artefact removal, aiming to reduce imaging radiation
exposure. A key contribution is extending the "InDI" concept from 2D to a full
3D volumetric approach for medical images, implementing an iterative denoising
process that refines the CBCT volume directly from sparse-view input. A further
contribution is the generation of a large pseudo-CBCT dataset (16,182) from
chest CT volumes of the CT-RATE public dataset to robustly train MInDI-3D. We
performed a comprehensive evaluation, including quantitative metrics,
scalability analysis, generalisation tests, and a clinical assessment by 11
clinicians. Our results show MInDI-3D's effectiveness, achieving a 12.96 (6.10)
dB PSNR gain over uncorrected scans with only 50 projections on the CT-RATE
pseudo-CBCT (independent real-world) test set and enabling an 8x reduction in
imaging radiation exposure. We demonstrate its scalability by showing that
performance improves with more training data. Importantly, MInDI-3D matches the
performance of a 3D U-Net on real-world scans from 16 cancer patients across
distortion and task-based metrics. It also generalises to new CBCT scanner
geometries. Clinicians rated our model as sufficient for patient positioning
across all anatomical sites and found it preserved lung tumour boundaries well.

Conclusion: 提出的信息优化框架有效减少了假阳性检测，提升了平面检测的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Plane detection from depth images is a crucial subtask with broad robotic
applications, often accomplished by iterative methods such as Random Sample
Consensus (RANSAC). While RANSAC is a robust strategy with strong probabilistic
guarantees, the ambiguity of its inlier threshold criterion makes it
susceptible to false positive plane detections. This issue is particularly
prevalent in complex real-world scenes, where the true number of planes is
unknown and multiple planes coexist. In this paper, we aim to address this
limitation by proposing a generalised framework for plane detection based on
model information optimization. Building on previous works, we treat the
observed depth readings as discrete random variables, with their probability
distributions constrained by the ground truth planes. Various models containing
different candidate plane constraints are then generated through repeated
random sub-sampling to explain our observations. By incorporating the physics
and noise model of the depth sensor, we can calculate the information for each
model, and the model with the least information is accepted as the most likely
ground truth. This information optimization process serves as an objective
mechanism for determining the true number of planes and preventing false
positive detections. Additionally, the quality of each detected plane can be
ranked by summing the information reduction of inlier points for each plane. We
validate these properties through experiments with synthetic data and find that
our algorithm estimates plane parameters more accurately compared to the
default Open3D RANSAC plane segmentation. Furthermore, we accelerate our
algorithm by partitioning the depth map using neural network segmentation,
which enhances its ability to generate more realistic plane parameters in
real-world data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SAD-Splat的新方法，通过高斯点丢弃模块和高置信度伪标签生成管道，解决了3D航空场景语义分割中的语义模糊问题，并引入了一个新的基准数据集3D-AS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在3D航空场景语义分割中难以解决尺度变化和结构遮挡导致的语义模糊问题，限制了分割精度和一致性。

Method: SAD-Splat方法结合了高斯点丢弃模块（基于Hard Concrete分布的可学习稀疏机制）和高置信度伪标签生成管道（利用2D基础模型增强监督）。

Result: 实验结果表明，SAD-Splat在分割精度和表示紧凑性之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: SAD-Splat为3D航空场景理解提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In the task of 3D Aerial-view Scene Semantic Segmentation (3D-AVS-SS),
traditional methods struggle to address semantic ambiguity caused by scale
variations and structural occlusions in aerial images. This limits their
segmentation accuracy and consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
novel 3D-AVS-SS approach named SAD-Splat. Our method introduces a Gaussian
point drop module, which integrates semantic confidence estimation with a
learnable sparsity mechanism based on the Hard Concrete distribution. This
module effectively eliminates redundant and semantically ambiguous Gaussian
points, enhancing both segmentation performance and representation compactness.
Furthermore, SAD-Splat incorporates a high-confidence pseudo-label generation
pipeline. It leverages 2D foundation models to enhance supervision when
ground-truth labels are limited, thereby further improving segmentation
accuracy. To advance research in this domain, we introduce a challenging
benchmark dataset: 3D Aerial Semantic (3D-AS), which encompasses diverse
real-world aerial scenes with sparse annotations. Experimental results
demonstrate that SAD-Splat achieves an excellent balance between segmentation
accuracy and representation compactness. It offers an efficient and scalable
solution for 3D aerial scene understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高性能模型在手部几何与图像外观的对齐上存在不足，纹理对齐可能是一个未被充分利用的监督信号。

Method: 提出一个轻量级纹理模块，结合可微分渲染和已知拓扑的3D手部网格模型，通过像素对齐损失优化重建结果。

Result: 该方法提升了HaMeR模型的精度和真实感，验证了外观引导对齐在手部重建中的价值。

Conclusion: 纹理对齐可以作为有效的监督信号，显著提升3D手部重建的性能。

Abstract: We revisit the role of texture in monocular 3D hand reconstruction, not as an
afterthought for photorealism, but as a dense, spatially grounded cue that can
actively support pose and shape estimation. Our observation is simple: even in
high-performing models, the overlay between predicted hand geometry and image
appearance is often imperfect, suggesting that texture alignment may be an
underused supervisory signal. We propose a lightweight texture module that
embeds per-pixel observations into UV texture space and enables a novel dense
alignment loss between predicted and observed hand appearances. Our approach
assumes access to a differentiable rendering pipeline and a model that maps
images to 3D hand meshes with known topology, allowing us to back-project a
textured hand onto the image and perform pixel-based alignment. The module is
self-contained and easily pluggable into existing reconstruction pipelines. To
isolate and highlight the value of texture-guided supervision, we augment
HaMeR, a high-performing yet unadorned transformer architecture for 3D hand
pose estimation. The resulting system improves both accuracy and realism,
demonstrating the value of appearance-guided alignment in hand reconstruction.

Preacher, the first paper-to-video agentic system. Preacher employs a top-down
approach to decompose, summarize, and reformulate the paper, followed by
bottom-up video generation, synthesizing diverse video segments into a coherent
abstract. To align cross-modal representations, we define key scenes and
introduce a Progressive Chain of Thought (P-CoT) for granular, iterative
planning. Preacher successfully generates high-quality video abstracts across
five research fields, demonstrating expertise beyond current video generation
models. Code will be released at: https://github.com/GenVerse/Paper2Video

Abstract: Purpose: Prenatal ultrasound is a key tool in evaluating fetal structural
development and detecting abnormalities, contributing to reduced perinatal
complications and improved neonatal survival. Accurate identification of
standard fetal torso planes is essential for reliable assessment and
personalized prenatal care. However, limitations such as low contrast and
unclear texture details in ultrasound imaging pose significant challenges for
fine-grained anatomical recognition. Methods: We propose a novel Multi-Contrast
Fusion Module (MCFM) to enhance the model's ability to extract detailed
information from ultrasound images. MCFM operates exclusively on the lower
layers of the neural network, directly processing raw ultrasound data. By
assigning attention weights to image representations under different contrast
conditions, the module enhances feature modeling while explicitly maintaining
minimal parameter overhead. Results: The proposed MCFM was evaluated on a
curated dataset of fetal torso plane ultrasound images. Experimental results
demonstrate that MCFM substantially improves recognition performance, with a
minimal increase in model complexity. The integration of multi-contrast
attention enables the model to better capture subtle anatomical structures,
contributing to higher classification accuracy and clinical reliability.
Conclusions: Our method provides an effective solution for improving fetal
torso plane recognition in ultrasound imaging. By enhancing feature
representation through multi-contrast fusion, the proposed approach supports
clinicians in achieving more accurate and consistent diagnoses, demonstrating
strong potential for clinical adoption in prenatal screening. The codes are

Conclusion: PG-SAM通过融合专家知识和多模态信息，显著提升了腮腺病变分割的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Parotid gland lesion segmentation is essential for the treatment of parotid
gland diseases. However, due to the variable size and complex lesion
boundaries, accurate parotid gland lesion segmentation remains challenging.
Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) fine-tuning has shown remarkable
performance in the field of medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, SAM's
interaction segmentation model relies heavily on precise lesion prompts
(points, boxes, masks, etc.), which are very difficult to obtain in real-world
applications. Besides, current medical image segmentation methods are
automatically generated, ignoring the domain knowledge of medical experts when
performing segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose the parotid
gland segment anything model (PG-SAM), an expert diagnosis text-guided SAM
incorporating expert domain knowledge for cross-sequence parotid gland lesion
segmentation. Specifically, we first propose an expert diagnosis report guided
prompt generation module that can automatically generate prompt information
containing the prior domain knowledge to guide the subsequent lesion
segmentation process. Then, we introduce a cross-sequence attention module,
which integrates the complementary information of different modalities to
enhance the segmentation effect. Finally, the multi-sequence image features and
generated prompts are feed into the decoder to get segmentation result.
Experimental results demonstrate that PG-SAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in parotid gland lesion segmentation across three independent
clinical centers, validating its clinical applicability and the effectiveness
of diagnostic text for enhancing image segmentation in real-world clinical
settings.

Abstract: Accurate intraoperative image guidance is critical for achieving maximal safe
resection in brain tumor surgery, yet neuronavigation systems based on
preoperative MRI lose accuracy during the procedure due to brain shift.
Aligning post-resection intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) with preoperative MRI
can restore spatial accuracy by estimating brain shift deformations, but it
remains a challenging problem given the large anatomical and topological
changes and substantial modality intensity gap. The ReMIND2Reg 2025 Challenge
provides the largest public benchmark for this task, built upon the ReMIND
dataset. It offers 99 training cases, 5 validation cases, and 10 private test
cases comprising paired 3D ceT1 MRI, T2 MRI, and post-resection 3D iUS volumes.
Data are provided without annotations for training, while validation and test
performance are evaluated on manually annotated anatomical landmarks. Metrics
include target registration error (TRE), robustness to worst-case landmark
misalignment (TRE30), and runtime. By establishing a standardized evaluation
framework for this clinically critical and technically complex problem,
ReMIND2Reg aims to accelerate the development of robust, generalizable, and
clinically deployable multimodal registration algorithms for image-guided
neurosurgery.

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在快速扫描和稀疏照明点数据下表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂场景下的NLOS成像提供了可行解决方案，兼具高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Computational imaging, especially non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging, the
extraction of information from obscured or hidden scenes is achieved through
the utilization of indirect light signals resulting from multiple reflections
or scattering. The inherently weak nature of these signals, coupled with their
susceptibility to noise, necessitates the integration of physical processes to
ensure accurate reconstruction. This paper presents a parameterized inverse
problem framework tailored for large-scale linear problems in 3D imaging
reconstruction. Initially, a noise estimation module is employed to adaptively
assess the noise levels present in transient data. Subsequently, a
parameterized neural operator is developed to approximate the inverse mapping,
facilitating end-to-end rapid image reconstruction. Our 3D image reconstruction
framework, grounded in operator learning, is constructed through deep algorithm
unfolding, which not only provides commendable model interpretability but also
enables dynamic adaptation to varying noise levels in the acquired data,
thereby ensuring consistently robust and accurate reconstruction outcomes.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel method for the fusion of global and local
spatiotemporal data features. By integrating structural and detailed
information, this method significantly enhances both accuracy and robustness.
Comprehensive numerical experiments conducted on both simulated and real
datasets substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method. It demonstrates
remarkable performance with fast scanning data and sparse illumination point
data, offering a viable solution for NLOS imaging in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: NegFaceDiff通过负条件采样有效提升了生成数据的质量，为人脸识别系统的训练提供了更优的合成数据解决方案。

Abstract: The use of synthetic data as an alternative to authentic datasets in face
recognition (FR) development has gained significant attention, addressing
privacy, ethical, and practical concerns associated with collecting and using
authentic data. Recent state-of-the-art approaches have proposed
identity-conditioned diffusion models to generate identity-consistent face
images, facilitating their use in training FR models. However, these methods
often lack explicit sampling mechanisms to enforce inter-class separability,
leading to identity overlap in the generated data and, consequently, suboptimal
FR performance. In this work, we introduce NegFaceDiff, a novel sampling method
that incorporates negative conditions into the identity-conditioned diffusion
process. NegFaceDiff enhances identity separation by leveraging negative
conditions that explicitly guide the model away from unwanted features while
preserving intra-class consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
NegFaceDiff significantly improves the identity consistency and separability of
data generated by identity-conditioned diffusion models. Specifically, identity
separability, measured by the Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR), increases from
2.427 to 5.687. These improvements are reflected in FR systems trained on the
NegFaceDiff dataset, which outperform models trained on data generated without
negative conditions across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: GSFixer通过结合多模态特征显著提升了稀疏视图下3DGS重建的质量，为相关领域提供了新思路和基准。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from sparse views
is an ill-posed problem due to insufficient information, often resulting in
noticeable artifacts. While recent approaches have sought to leverage
generative priors to complete information for under-constrained regions, they
struggle to generate content that remains consistent with input observations.
To address this challenge, we propose GSFixer, a novel framework designed to
improve the quality of 3DGS representations reconstructed from sparse inputs.
The core of our approach is the reference-guided video restoration model, built
upon a DiT-based video diffusion model trained on paired artifact 3DGS renders
and clean frames with additional reference-based conditions. Considering the
input sparse views as references, our model integrates both 2D semantic
features and 3D geometric features of reference views extracted from the visual
geometry foundation model, enhancing the semantic coherence and 3D consistency
when fixing artifact novel views. Furthermore, considering the lack of suitable
benchmarks for 3DGS artifact restoration evaluation, we present DL3DV-Res which
contains artifact frames rendered using low-quality 3DGS. Extensive experiments
demonstrate our GSFixer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in 3DGS
artifact restoration and sparse-view 3D reconstruction. Project page:

Conclusion: 该方法在手术场景中表现出色，为长期3D点跟踪提供了高效且精确的解决方案。

Abstract: We proposed a novel test-time optimisation (TTO) approach framed by a
NeRF-based architecture for long-term 3D point tracking. Most current methods
in point tracking struggle to obtain consistent motion or are limited to 2D
motion. TTO approaches frame the solution for long-term tracking as optimising
a function that aggregates correspondences from other specialised
state-of-the-art methods. Unlike the state-of-the-art on TTO, we propose
parametrising such a function with our new invertible Neural Radiance Field
(InvNeRF) architecture to perform both 2D and 3D tracking in surgical
scenarios. Our approach allows us to exploit the advantages of a
rendering-based approach by supervising the reprojection of pixel
correspondences. It adapts strategies from recent rendering-based methods to
obtain a bidirectional deformable-canonical mapping, to efficiently handle a
defined workspace, and to guide the rays' density. It also presents our
multi-scale HexPlanes for fast inference and a new algorithm for efficient
pixel sampling and convergence criteria. We present results in the STIR and
SCARE datasets, for evaluating point tracking and testing the integration of
kinematic data in our pipeline, respectively. In 2D point tracking, our
approach surpasses the precision and accuracy of the TTO state-of-the-art
methods by nearly 50% on average precision, while competing with other
approaches. In 3D point tracking, this is the first TTO approach, surpassing
feed-forward methods while incorporating the benefits of a deformable
NeRF-based reconstruction.

Abstract: Facial representation pre-training is crucial for tasks like facial
recognition, expression analysis, and virtual reality. However, existing
methods face three key challenges: (1) failing to capture distinct facial
features and fine-grained semantics, (2) ignoring the spatial structure
inherent to facial anatomy, and (3) inefficiently utilizing limited labeled
data. To overcome these, we introduce PaCo-FR, an unsupervised framework that
combines masked image modeling with patch-pixel alignment. Our approach
integrates three innovative components: (1) a structured masking strategy that
preserves spatial coherence by aligning with semantically meaningful facial
regions, (2) a novel patch-based codebook that enhances feature discrimination
with multiple candidate tokens, and (3) spatial consistency constraints that
preserve geometric relationships between facial components. PaCo-FR achieves
state-of-the-art performance across several facial analysis tasks with just 2
million unlabeled images for pre-training. Our method demonstrates significant
improvements, particularly in scenarios with varying poses, occlusions, and
lighting conditions. We believe this work advances facial representation
learning and offers a scalable, efficient solution that reduces reliance on
expensive annotated datasets, driving more effective facial analysis systems.

Abstract: Irrelevant features can significantly degrade few-shot learn ing performance.
This problem is used to match queries and support images based on meaningful
similarities despite the limited data. However, in this process, non-relevant
fea tures such as background elements can easily lead to confu sion and
misclassification. To address this issue, we pro pose Slot Attention-based
Feature Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SAFF) that leverages slot attention
mechanisms to discriminate and filter weak features, thereby improving few-shot
classification performance. The key innovation of SAFF lies in its integration
of slot attention with patch em beddings, unifying class-aware slots into a
single attention mechanism to filter irrelevant features effectively. We intro
duce a similarity matrix that computes across support and query images to
quantify the relevance of filtered embed dings for classification. Through
experiments, we demon strate that Slot Attention performs better than other
atten tion mechanisms, capturing discriminative features while reducing
irrelevant information. We validate our approach through extensive experiments
on few-shot learning bench marks: CIFAR-FS, FC100, miniImageNet and tieredIma

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved the
performance of reference-guided line art colorization. However, existing
methods still struggle with region-level color consistency, especially when the
reference and target images differ in character pose or motion. Instead of
relying on external matching annotations between the reference and target, we
propose to discover semantic correspondences implicitly through internal
attention mechanisms. In this paper, we present MangaDiT, a powerful model for
reference-guided line art colorization based on Diffusion Transformers (DiT).
Our model takes both line art and reference images as conditional inputs and
introduces a hierarchical attention mechanism with a dynamic attention
weighting strategy. This mechanism augments the vanilla attention with an
additional context-aware path that leverages pooled spatial features,
effectively expanding the model's receptive field and enhancing region-level
color alignment. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

*Devvrat Joshi,Islem Rekik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NEURAL是一种新颖的多模态医学图像压缩框架，通过语义引导的数据压缩显著减少存储和传输需求，同时保持高诊断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决资源受限临床环境中多模态医学图像数据的存储和传输挑战。

Method: 利用生成式视觉语言模型的交叉注意力分数对胸部X光进行结构性剪枝，生成高度压缩的图表示，并与临床报告的知识图融合。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和CheXpert Plus数据集上，NEURAL实现了93.4-97.7%的图像数据压缩，诊断AUC为0.88-0.95，优于基线模型。

Conclusion: NEURAL通过任务无关的数据资产解决了数据大小与临床效用之间的权衡，支持高效工作流程和远程放射学。

Abstract: The rapid growth of multimodal medical imaging data presents significant
storage and transmission challenges, particularly in resource-constrained
clinical settings. We propose NEURAL, a novel framework that addresses this by
using semantics-guided data compression. Our approach repurposes
cross-attention scores between the image and its radiological report from a
fine-tuned generative vision-language model to structurally prune chest X-rays,
preserving only diagnostically critical regions. This process transforms the
image into a highly compressed, graph representation. This unified graph-based
representation fuses the pruned visual graph with a knowledge graph derived
from the clinical report, creating a universal data structure that simplifies
downstream modeling. Validated on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus dataset for
pneumonia detection, NEURAL achieves a 93.4-97.7\% reduction in image data size
while maintaining a high diagnostic performance of 0.88-0.95 AUC, outperforming
other baseline models that use uncompressed data. By creating a persistent,
task-agnostic data asset, NEURAL resolves the trade-off between data size and
clinical utility, enabling efficient workflows and teleradiology without
sacrificing performance. Our NEURAL code is available at

Result: 模型在基线方法上表现优越，且在数据缺失或不完整情况下具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架为虚拟活检工具的快速诊断提供了支持，代码已开源。

Abstract: Glioblastoma is a highly invasive brain tumor with rapid progression rates.
Recent studies have shown that glioblastoma molecular subtype classification
serves as a significant biomarker for effective targeted therapy selection.
However, this classification currently requires invasive tissue extraction for
comprehensive histopathological analysis. Existing multimodal approaches
combining MRI and histopathology images are limited and lack robust mechanisms
for preserving shared structural information across modalities. In particular,
graph-based models often fail to retain discriminative features within
heterogeneous graphs, and structural reconstruction mechanisms for handling
missing or incomplete modality data are largely underexplored. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel sheaf-based framework for structure-aware and
consistent fusion of MRI and histopathology data. Our model outperforms
baseline methods and demonstrates robustness in incomplete or missing data
scenarios, contributing to the development of virtual biopsy tools for rapid
diagnostics. Our source code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven computer vision have enabled robust autonomous
navigation capabilities for civil aviation, including automated landing and
runway detection. However, ensuring that these systems meet the robustness and
safety requirements for aviation applications remains a major challenge. In
this work, we present a practical vision-based pipeline for aircraft pose
estimation from runway images that represents a step toward the ability to
certify these systems for use in safety-critical aviation applications. Our
approach features three key innovations: (i) an efficient, flexible neural
architecture based on a spatial Soft Argmax operator for probabilistic keypoint
regression, supporting diverse vision backbones with real-time inference; (ii)
a principled loss function producing calibrated predictive uncertainties, which
are evaluated via sharpness and calibration metrics; and (iii) an adaptation of
Residual-based Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM), enabling
runtime detection and rejection of faulty model outputs. We implement and
evaluate our pose estimation pipeline on a dataset of runway images. We show
that our model outperforms baseline architectures in terms of accuracy while
also producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates with sub-pixel precision
that can be used downstream for fault detection.

Motivation: 研究旨在开发一种更接近人类长期记忆能力的多模态代理，以提升其在复杂任务中的表现。

Method: M3-Agent采用实体中心的多模态记忆组织方式，结合强化学习训练，并在M3-Bench基准测试上进行评估。

Result: M3-Agent在M3-Bench-robot、M3-Bench-web和VideoMME-long上的准确率分别比基线模型高出6.7%、7.7%和5.3%。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了多模态代理向更接近人类长期记忆的方向发展，并提供了实用的设计思路。

Abstract: We introduce M3-Agent, a novel multimodal agent framework equipped with
long-term memory. Like humans, M3-Agent can process real-time visual and
auditory inputs to build and update its long-term memory. Beyond episodic
memory, it also develops semantic memory, enabling it to accumulate world
knowledge over time. Its memory is organized in an entity-centric, multimodal
format, allowing deeper and more consistent understanding of the environment.
Given an instruction, M3-Agent autonomously performs multi-turn, iterative
reasoning and retrieves relevant information from memory to accomplish the
task. To evaluate memory effectiveness and memory-based reasoning in multimodal
agents, we develop M3-Bench, a new long-video question answering benchmark.
M3-Bench comprises 100 newly recorded real-world videos captured from a robot's
perspective (M3-Bench-robot) and 929 web-sourced videos across diverse
scenarios (M3-Bench-web). We annotate question-answer pairs designed to test
key capabilities essential for agent applications, such as human understanding,
general knowledge extraction, and cross-modal reasoning. Experimental results
show that M3-Agent, trained via reinforcement learning, outperforms the
strongest baseline, a prompting agent using Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o,
achieving 6.7%, 7.7%, and 5.3% higher accuracy on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web
and VideoMME-long, respectively. Our work advances the multimodal agents toward
more human-like long-term memory and provides insights into their practical
design. Model, code and data are available at

Result: 实验表明该方法在定量指标和视觉协调性上优于其他方法，且新数据集提升了模型在真实场景中的表现。

Conclusion: R2R方法显著提升了图像协调效果，公开的代码、数据集和模型权重促进了进一步研究。

Abstract: The goal of image harmonization is to adjust the foreground in a composite
image to achieve visual consistency with the background. Recently, latent
diffusion model (LDM) are applied for harmonization, achieving remarkable
results. However, LDM-based harmonization faces challenges in detail
preservation and limited harmonization ability. Additionally, current synthetic
datasets rely on color transfer, which lacks local variations and fails to
capture complex real-world lighting conditions. To enhance harmonization
capabilities, we propose the Region-to-Region transformation. By injecting
information from appropriate regions into the foreground, this approach
preserves original details while achieving image harmonization or, conversely,
generating new composite data. From this perspective, We propose a novel model
R2R. Specifically, we design Clear-VAE to preserve high-frequency details in
the foreground using Adaptive Filter while eliminating disharmonious elements.
To further enhance harmonization, we introduce the Harmony Controller with
Mask-aware Adaptive Channel Attention (MACA), which dynamically adjusts the
foreground based on the channel importance of both foreground and background
regions. To address the limitation of existing datasets, we propose Random
Poisson Blending, which transfers color and lighting information from a
suitable region to the foreground, thereby generating more diverse and
challenging synthetic images. Using this method, we construct a new synthetic
dataset, RPHarmony. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over
other methods in both quantitative metrics and visual harmony. Moreover, our
dataset helps the model generate more realistic images in real examples. Our
code, dataset, and model weights have all been released for open access.

Motivation: 尽管大型视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现优异，但其计算成本高昂，稀疏混合专家架构（MoE）虽能提升参数效率，但在同时建模模态内特征和跨模态关联方面仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出MoIIE架构，通过模态引导的路由机制将令牌分配给模态内专家和共享的跨模态专家池，并引入两阶段训练策略激活MoE和多模态能力。

Result: 实验表明，MoIIE模型在5.5B和11.3B激活参数下，性能匹配甚至超越现有开源MoE-LLMs多模态模型。

Conclusion: MoIIE架构在提升效率和性能方面表现出色，为稀疏混合专家在多模态任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
across multi-modal tasks by scaling model size and training data. However,
these dense LVLMs incur significant computational costs and motivate the
exploration of sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures. While MoE improve
parameter efficiency, effectively applying MoE to simultaneously model
modality-specific features and cross-modal associations in LVLMs remains
challenging. In this work, we propose to incorporate Mixture of Intra- and
Inter-Modality Experts (MoIIE) to LVLMs. For each token, expert routing is
guided by its modality, directing tokens to their respective intra-modality
experts as well as a shared pool of inter-modality experts, enabling the model
to jointly learn rich intra-modal features and cross-modal interactions. We
further introduce an effective and straightforward two-stage training strategy,
which facilitates the direct activation of both MoE and multi-modal
capabilities. Extensive experiments across different data scales and LLM
backbone demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and generality of our
approach. Notably, our MoIIE models with 5.5B and 11.3B activated parameters
match or even surpass the performance of existing advanced open-source MoE-LLMs
based multi-modal models that involve more activated parameters. The code is

<details>

Motivation: 传统几何装配方法通常依赖于通过寻找部件之间的相同表面对齐部件，而本文方法则明确建模了互锁形状的两个特性，以解决匹配中的局部模糊性问题。

Result: 在几何装配基准测试中，该方法表现优异，显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 组合匹配方法通过建模互锁形状的特性，实现了更稳健的部件组合，为几何装配提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new shape-matching methodology, combinative matching,
to combine interlocking parts for geometric shape assembly. Previous methods
for geometric assembly typically rely on aligning parts by finding identical
surfaces between the parts as in conventional shape matching and registration.
In contrast, we explicitly model two distinct properties of interlocking
shapes: 'identical surface shape' and 'opposite volume occupancy.' Our method
thus learns to establish correspondences across regions where their surface
shapes appear identical but their volumes occupy the inverted space to each
other. To facilitate this process, we also learn to align regions in rotation
by estimating their shape orientations via equivariant neural networks. The
proposed approach significantly reduces local ambiguities in matching and
allows a robust combination of parts in assembly. Experimental results on
geometric assembly benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our method,
consistently outperforming the state of the art. Project page:

Result: 在四个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，有效缓解灾难性遗忘问题。

Conclusion: DSS-Prompt在FSCIL任务中表现优异，无需增量任务额外训练即可超越现有方法。

Abstract: Learning from large-scale pre-trained models with strong generalization
ability has shown remarkable success in a wide range of downstream tasks
recently, but it is still underexplored in the challenging few-shot
class-incremental learning (FSCIL) task. It aims to continually learn new
concepts from limited training samples without forgetting the old ones at the
same time. In this paper, we introduce DSS-Prompt, a simple yet effective
approach that transforms the pre-trained Vision Transformer with minimal
modifications in the way of prompts into a strong FSCIL classifier. Concretely,
we synergistically utilize two complementary types of prompts in each
Transformer block: static prompts to bridge the domain gap between the
pre-training and downstream datasets, thus enabling better adaption; and
dynamic prompts to capture instance-aware semantics, thus enabling easy
transfer from base to novel classes. Specially, to generate dynamic prompts, we
leverage a pre-trained multi-modal model to extract input-related diverse
semantics, thereby generating complementary input-aware prompts, and then
adaptively adjust their importance across different layers. In this way, on top
of the prompted visual embeddings, a simple prototype classifier can beat
state-of-the-arts without further training on the incremental tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments on four benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of our
DSS-Prompt and show that it consistently achieves better performance than
existing approaches on all datasets and can alleviate the catastrophic
forgetting issue as well.

Motivation: 传统跟踪方法依赖卡尔曼滤波和刚性IoU匹配，在复杂运动和遮挡下表现不佳。

Method: 提出MeKF（记忆辅助卡尔曼滤波）和Mo-IoU（自适应IoU匹配），优化运动模型和匹配空间。

Result: 在DanceTrack和SportsMOT数据集上，HOTA分数分别达到67.9%和82.1%。

Conclusion: MeMoSORT在复杂场景下表现优异，具有实时性和高效性。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in human-dominant scenarios, which involves
continuously tracking multiple people within video sequences, remains a
significant challenge in computer vision due to targets' complex motion and
severe occlusions. Conventional tracking-by-detection methods are fundamentally
limited by their reliance on Kalman filter (KF) and rigid Intersection over
Union (IoU)-based association. The motion model in KF often mismatches
real-world object dynamics, causing filtering errors, while rigid association
struggles under occlusions, leading to identity switches or target loss. To
address these issues, we propose MeMoSORT, a simple, online, and real-time MOT
tracker with two key innovations. First, the Memory-assisted Kalman filter
(MeKF) uses memory-augmented neural networks to compensate for mismatches
between assumed and actual object motion. Second, the Motion-adaptive IoU
(Mo-IoU) adaptively expands the matching space and incorporates height
similarity to reduce the influence of detection errors and association
failures, while remaining lightweight. Experiments on DanceTrack and SportsMOT
show that MeMoSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with HOTA scores of
67.9\% and 82.1\%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PBR材料的超分辨率重建对现代3D图形应用至关重要，但现有SISR方法存在跨图不一致、模态特征建模不足和数据分布偏移等问题。

Method: 提出MUJICA，一种灵活的适配器，通过跨图注意力机制融合特征，同时保留预训练SISR模型的重建能力。

Result: MUJICA显著提升了PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS分数，并在PBR材料数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MUJICA在资源有限的情况下仍能高效训练，为PBR材料超分辨率提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials are typically characterized by
multiple 2D texture maps such as basecolor, normal, metallic, and roughness
which encode spatially-varying bi-directional reflectance distribution function
(SVBRDF) parameters to model surface reflectance properties and microfacet
interactions. Upscaling SVBRDF material is valuable for modern 3D graphics
applications. However, existing Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) methods
struggle with cross-map inconsistency, inadequate modeling of modality-specific
features, and limited generalization due to data distribution shifts. In this
work, we propose Multi-modal Upscaling Joint Inference via Cross-map Attention
(MUJICA), a flexible adapter that reforms pre-trained Swin-transformer-based
SISR models for PBR material super-resolution. MUJICA is seamlessly attached
after the pre-trained and frozen SISR backbone. It leverages cross-map
attention to fuse features while preserving remarkable reconstruction ability
of the pre-trained SISR model. Applied to SISR models such as SwinIR, DRCT, and
HMANet, MUJICA improves PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS scores while preserving cross-map
consistency. Experiments demonstrate that MUJICA enables efficient training
even with limited resources and delivers state-of-the-art performance on PBR
material datasets.

Motivation: 脑库和神经病理学实验室常规收集的脑组织照片需要手动分割，成本高昂且耗时。本文旨在开发一种自动化工具以解决这一问题。

Method: 使用U-Net架构，结合1,414张手动分割的图像和2,000张合成的MRI图像进行训练，以提高模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Advances in image registration and machine learning have recently enabled
volumetric analysis of \emph{postmortem} brain tissue from conventional
photographs of coronal slabs, which are routinely collected in brain banks and
neuropathology laboratories worldwide. One caveat of this methodology is the
requirement of segmentation of the tissue from photographs, which currently
requires costly manual intervention. In this article, we present a deep
learning model to automate this process. The automatic segmentation tool relies
on a U-Net architecture that was trained with a combination of
\textit{(i)}1,414 manually segmented images of both fixed and fresh tissue,
from specimens with varying diagnoses, photographed at two different sites; and
\textit{(ii)}~2,000 synthetic images with randomized contrast and corresponding
masks generated from MRI scans for improved generalizability to unseen
photographic setups. Automated model predictions on a subset of photographs not
seen in training were analyzed to estimate performance compared to manual
labels -- including both inter- and intra-rater variability. Our model achieved
a median Dice score over 0.98, mean surface distance under 0.4~mm, and 95\%
Hausdorff distance under 1.60~mm, which approaches inter-/intra-rater levels.

Motivation: 现有方法通过物理约束或简单物理模型难以学习复杂运动物理，且常需额外标注（如物体类型或掩码）。

Method: 将每个3D点视为具有大小和方向的刚性粒子，直接学习其平移旋转动力学系统，显式估计物理参数以控制粒子运动。

Conclusion: TRACE框架无需人工标注即可建模复杂动态3D场景的物理运动，且具有高效分割能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to model 3D scene geometry, appearance, and physical
information just from dynamic multi-view videos in the absence of any human
labels. By leveraging physics-informed losses as soft constraints or
integrating simple physics models into neural nets, existing works often fail
to learn complex motion physics, or doing so requires additional labels such as
object types or masks. We propose a new framework named TRACE to model the
motion physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes. The key novelty of our method is
that, by formulating each 3D point as a rigid particle with size and
orientation in space, we directly learn a translation rotation dynamics system
for each particle, explicitly estimating a complete set of physical parameters
to govern the particle's motion over time. Extensive experiments on three
existing dynamic datasets and one newly created challenging synthetic datasets
demonstrate the extraordinary performance of our method over baselines in the
task of future frame extrapolation. A nice property of our framework is that
multiple objects or parts can be easily segmented just by clustering the
learned physical parameters.

Abstract: Elephant Poaching in African countries has been a decade-old problem. So much
so that African Forest Elephants are now listed as an endangered species, and
African Savannah Elephants as critically endangered by the IUCN (International
Union for Conservation of Nature). [1] Elephants are hunted primarily for their
ivory tusks which caused many elephants to be born tuskless as a genetic
modification for survival. [2] Data gathered by recent studies shows that
though poaching methods remain the same, the poaching grounds are rather
dynamic. Poachers have shifted to areas with less ranger patrols and several
other factors like watering holes, seasons, altitude etc. cause constant shifts
in poaching hotspot locations. [3] After a period of low poaching from
2000-2014, poaching numbers in African countries are now on the rise again --
WWF (World Wildlife Foundation) says there are 20,000 elephants poached
annually [4]. In African countries, anti-poaching efforts are concentrated near
towns, while a majority of poaching occurs in the deserted regions. All of
these factors result in the need for a Computer Vision Model to identify
poaching hotspots through locating the geographic indicators of favorable
poaching regions. A CV model eliminates the need to manually track poachers and
account for the environmental factors to deploy resources and its combination
with satellite imagery allows us to survey large areas without disturbing local
species or cross border aviation restrictions.

Method: 通过分析形状-纹理偏置对齐和噪声下的分类准确性变化，研究CLIP模型的学习机制。

Result: CLIP初期学习低层次视觉特征，与人类感知对齐较好但噪声敏感；后期转向抽象形状表示，增强鲁棒性但降低对齐。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了CLIP模型学习机制的权衡，为优化视觉-语言模型的感知对齐与鲁棒性提供了新见解。

Abstract: During the training of multi-modal models like CLIP, we observed an
intriguing phenomenon: the correlation with low-level human image quality
assessments peaks in the early epochs before gradually declining. This study
investigates this observation and seeks to understand its causes through two
key factors: shape-texture bias alignment and classification accuracy drop
under noise. Our findings suggest that CLIP initially learn low-level visual
features, enhancing its alignment with low-level human perception but also
increasing its sensitivity to noise and its texture bias. As training
progresses, the model shifts toward more abstract shape-based representations,
improving noise robustness but reducing alignment with low-level human
perception. These results suggest that these factors shared an underlying
learning mechanism and provide new insights into optimizing the trade-off
between perceptual alignment and robustness in vision-language models.

TL;DR: ViMoNet是一种结合视频和运动数据的框架，用于理解和推断人类行为，通过联合训练策略和新型数据集VIMOS，在多项任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型仅关注单一数据类型（运动或视频），无法全面捕捉人类行为的细微差别，因此需要结合两者以更全面地理解行为。

Method: 提出ViMoNet框架，采用联合训练策略，结合精确的运动-文本数据和广泛的视频-文本数据，并引入新数据集VIMOS和评估基准ViMoNet-Bench。

Result: ViMoNet在生成字幕、理解运动和行为解释方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合视频和运动数据的ViMoNet框架在理解人类行为方面表现出色，验证了多数据类型联合训练的有效性。

Abstract: This study investigates how large language models (LLMs) can be used to
understand human behavior using motion and video data. We think that mixing
both types is essential to completely capture the nuanced movements and
meanings of human actions, in contrast to recent models that simply concentrate
on motion data or films. To address this, we provide ViMoNet, a straightforward
yet effective framework for comprehending, characterizing, and deducing human
action. ViMoNet employs a joint training strategy that leverages the advantages
of two data types: detailed motion-text data, which is more exact, and generic
video-text data, which is more comprehensive but less detailed. This aids in
the model's acquisition of rich data regarding time and space in human
behavior. Additionally, we provide a brand new dataset named VIMOS that
contains a variety of films, motion sequences, instructions, and subtitles. We
developed ViMoNet-Bench, a standardized benchmark with carefully labeled
samples, to evaluate how well models understand human behavior. Our tests show
that ViMoNet outperforms existing methods in caption generation, motion
understanding, and behavior interpretation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种物理自回归模型（PAR），利用视频预训练中的世界知识来理解物理动态，无需动作预训练，实现了准确的视频预测和一致的动作轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人操作数据的稀缺性促使研究者利用其他模态的预训练大模型。

Method: PAR结合帧和动作作为物理标记，采用DiT-based去标记器建模连续标记，并引入因果掩码、逆运动学、并行训练和KV缓存机制。

Result: 在ManiSkill基准测试中，PAR在PushCube任务上达到100%成功率，与其他任务的动作预训练基线性能相当，并能准确预测未来视频。

Conclusion: PAR展示了通过自回归视频预训练转移世界知识在机器人操作中的潜力。

Abstract: The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large
models from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon
autoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive
Model (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the
joint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world
knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without
requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent
action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames
and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and
facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with
inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further
improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show
that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the
performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately
predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings
underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world
knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.

*Xuhong Huang,Shiqi Liu,Kai Zhang,Ying Tai,Jian Yang,Hui Zeng,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型深度反向卷积算子，用于有效逆转深度卷积，并通过实验验证了其作为基础模块的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统转置卷积并非卷积的数学逆操作，缺乏标准化的反向卷积算子，限制了神经网络的设计与应用。

Method: 通过正则化最小二乘优化问题设计深度反向卷积算子，并结合层归一化、1×1卷积和GELU激活构建反向卷积块。

Result: 实验表明，该算子能直接替代传统卷积和转置卷积层，在图像去噪、超分辨率和去模糊任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该研究为深度学习模型设计中的新算子开发提供了新思路。

Abstract: Convolution and transposed convolution are fundamental operators widely used
in neural networks. However, transposed convolution (a.k.a. deconvolution) does
not serve as a true inverse of convolution due to inherent differences in their
mathematical formulations. To date, no reverse convolution operator has been
established as a standard component in neural architectures. In this paper, we
propose a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator as an initial attempt to
effectively reverse depthwise convolution by formulating and solving a
regularized least-squares optimization problem. We thoroughly investigate its
kernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure
its effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct
a reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization,
1$\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like
structure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional
convolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures,
leading to the development of ConverseNet. Corresponding to typical image
restoration models such as DnCNN, SRResNet and USRNet, we train three variants
of ConverseNet for Gaussian denoising, super-resolution and deblurring,
respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed reverse convolution operator as a basic building module. We hope this
work could pave the way for developing new operators in deep model design and
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RayletDF的新方法，用于从点云或RGB图像中的3D高斯分布重建3D表面，通过射线距离场直接预测表面点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于坐标的方法在渲染显式表面时计算量大，需要一种更高效且通用的方法。

Method: 采用三个关键模块：射线特征提取器、射线距离场预测器和多射线混合器，以提取几何特征、预测距离并聚合预测结果。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上表现优异，具有出色的泛化能力，能在未见过的数据集上单次前向传播重建3D表面。

Conclusion: RayletDF方法在3D表面重建中表现出高效性和通用性，适用于多种输入数据。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalizable method for 3D surface
reconstruction from raw point clouds or pre-estimated 3D Gaussians by 3DGS from
RGB images. Unlike existing coordinate-based methods which are often
computationally intensive when rendering explicit surfaces, our proposed
method, named RayletDF, introduces a new technique called raylet distance
field, which aims to directly predict surface points from query rays. Our
pipeline consists of three key modules: a raylet feature extractor, a raylet
distance field predictor, and a multi-raylet blender. These components work
together to extract fine-grained local geometric features, predict raylet
distances, and aggregate multiple predictions to reconstruct precise surface
points. We extensively evaluate our method on multiple public real-world
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in surface reconstruction from
point clouds or 3D Gaussians. Most notably, our method achieves exceptional
generalization ability, successfully recovering 3D surfaces in a single-forward
pass across unseen datasets in testing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图神经网络的OIQA框架，通过建模视口间的结构关系来提升对空间失真非均匀性的感知能力，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OIQA方法难以评估局部非均匀失真，主要由于对质量空间变化建模不足及特征表示未能同时捕捉局部细节和全局上下文。

Method: 采用斐波那契球采样生成视口，将其表示为图节点，结合多阶段特征提取网络和GAT与图变换器，分别建模局部和长程质量依赖关系。

Result: 在两个大规模OIQA数据库上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有方法，验证了其有效性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过建模视口间结构关系，有效解决了空间失真非均匀性评估问题，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Current Omnidirectional Image Quality Assessment (OIQA) methods struggle to
evaluate locally non-uniform distortions due to inadequate modeling of spatial
variations in quality and ineffective feature representation capturing both
local details and global context. To address this, we propose a graph neural
network-based OIQA framework that explicitly models structural relationships
between viewports to enhance perception of spatial distortion non-uniformity.
Our approach employs Fibonacci sphere sampling to generate viewports with
well-structured topology, representing each as a graph node. Multi-stage
feature extraction networks then derive high-dimensional node representation.
To holistically capture spatial dependencies, we integrate a Graph Attention
Network (GAT) modeling fine-grained local distortion variations among adjacent
viewports, and a graph transformer capturing long-range quality interactions
across distant regions. Extensive experiments on two large-scale OIQA databases
with complex spatial distortions demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, confirming its effectiveness and strong
generalization capability.

Abstract: We present a benchmark of diffusion models for human face generation on a
small-scale CelebAMask-HQ dataset, evaluating both unconditional and
conditional pipelines. Our study compares UNet and DiT architectures for
unconditional generation and explores LoRA-based fine-tuning of pretrained
Stable Diffusion models as a separate experiment. Building on the
multi-conditioning approach of Giambi and Lisanti, which uses both attribute
vectors and segmentation masks, our main contribution is the integration of an
InfoNCE loss for attribute embedding and the adoption of a SegFormer-based
segmentation encoder. These enhancements improve the semantic alignment and
controllability of attribute-guided synthesis. Our results highlight the
effectiveness of contrastive embedding learning and advanced segmentation
encoding for controlled face generation in limited data settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线CT成像技术存在多种固有成像伪影（如束硬化和部分体积效应），使得用户需要基于体素灰度值对微结构进行分割和分类，分析过程复杂且需要大量决策。

Method: 提出ARI3D软件工具，通过交互式分析协议辅助用户完成3D图像中区域的分类和量化步骤。

Result: ARI3D能够改进相位识别、处理部分体积效应、提高检测限和量化准确性，并实现跨学科的3D定量分析标准化。

Conclusion: ARI3D为X射线CT图像分析提供了一种高效且标准化的解决方案，有助于提升微结构定量分析的准确性和适用性。

Abstract: X-ray computed tomography (CT) is the main 3D technique for imaging the
internal microstructures of materials. Quantitative analysis of the
microstructures is usually achieved by applying a sequence of steps that are
implemented to the entire 3D image. This is challenged by various imaging
artifacts inherent from the technique, e.g., beam hardening and partial volume.
Consequently, the analysis requires users to make a number of decisions to
segment and classify the microstructures based on the voxel gray-values. In
this context, a software tool, here called ARI3D, is proposed to interactively
analyze regions in three-dimensional X-ray CT images, assisting users through
the various steps of a protocol designed to classify and quantify objects
within regions of a three-dimensional image. ARI3D aims to 1) Improve phase
identification; 2) Account for partial volume effect; 3) Increase the detection
limit and accuracy of object quantification; and 4) Harmonize quantitative 3D
analysis that can be implemented in different fields of science.

Motivation: 探索ViTs在图像识别任务中与人类感知的对齐情况，以了解模型复杂性和训练策略对其影响。

Method: 在TID2013数据集上系统分析模型大小、数据集规模、数据增强和正则化对ViT与人类感知对齐的影响。

Result: 发现更大的模型对齐性更低，数据集多样性影响有限，重复训练会降低对齐性，更强的数据增强和正则化进一步减少对齐性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型复杂性、训练策略与人类感知对齐之间的权衡，对需要类人视觉理解的应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve remarkable performance in image
recognition tasks, yet their alignment with human perception remains largely
unexplored. This study systematically analyzes how model size, dataset size,
data augmentation and regularization impact ViT perceptual alignment with human
judgments on the TID2013 dataset. Our findings confirm that larger models
exhibit lower perceptual alignment, consistent with previous works. Increasing
dataset diversity has a minimal impact, but exposing models to the same images
more times reduces alignment. Stronger data augmentation and regularization
further decrease alignment, especially in models exposed to repeated training
cycles. These results highlight a trade-off between model complexity, training
strategies, and alignment with human perception, raising important
considerations for applications requiring human-like visual understanding.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为OneVAE的方法，通过结合离散和连续视频VAE的优势，提升了离散视频VAE的训练稳定性、速度和重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散视频VAE在训练中存在不稳定、耗时长和重建质量差的问题，而连续VAE表现更优。论文旨在通过结合两者的优势来改进离散视频VAE。

Method: 利用FSQ保留预训练连续VAE的先验，提出多令牌量化机制和增强首帧重建的结构改进，并设计联合离散-连续优化方案。

Result: OneVAE收敛速度快数倍，重建质量显著提升（PSNR提高近1 dB），并在高压缩视频VAE中表现优异。

Conclusion: OneVAE首次在单一网络中实现了离散和连续视频表示的竞争性能，为多模态LLM提供了更高效的视频编码方法。

Abstract: Encoding videos into discrete tokens could align with text tokens to
facilitate concise and unified multi-modal LLMs, yet introducing significant
spatiotemporal compression compared to continuous video representation.
Previous discrete video VAEs experienced unstable training, long training time,
and degraded reconstruction quality. Given the easier training and superior
performance of continuous VAEs, an intuitive idea is to enhance discrete video
VAEs by leveraging continuous VAEs. After rethinking the intrinsic link between
discrete and continuous representations, we found that FSQ could effectively
preserve pre-trained continuous VAE priors compared to other quantization
methods. By leveraging continuous VAE priors, it converges several times faster
than training from scratch and achieves superior performance at convergence.
Meanwhile, two structural improvements are proposed. First, inspired by how
continuous VAEs enhance reconstruction via enlarged latent dimensions, we
introduce a multi-token quantization mechanism, which achieves nearly a 1 dB
improvement in PSNR without compromising the token compression ratio. Second,
to tackle reconstruction challenges in high-compression video VAEs, we
strengthen first-frame reconstruction, enabling the causal VAE to leverage this
information in subsequent frames and markedly improving the performance of 4 x
16 x 16 discrete VAEs. Furthermore, we propose a joint discrete-continuous
optimization scheme that unifies the two paradigms and, for the first time,
achieves competitive performance on both continuous and discrete
representations within a single network. We name our method OneVAE to reflect
this connection.

Conclusion: HumanGenesis通过多代理协作有效解决了现有挑战，为合成人类动态提供了高质量解决方案。

Abstract: \textbf{Synthetic human dynamics} aims to generate photorealistic videos of
human subjects performing expressive, intention-driven motions. However,
current approaches face two core challenges: (1) \emph{geometric inconsistency}
and \emph{coarse reconstruction}, due to limited 3D modeling and detail
preservation; and (2) \emph{motion generalization limitations} and \emph{scene
inharmonization}, stemming from weak generative capabilities. To address these,
we present \textbf{HumanGenesis}, a framework that integrates geometric and
generative modeling through four collaborative agents: (1)
\textbf{Reconstructor} builds 3D-consistent human-scene representations from
monocular video using 3D Gaussian Splatting and deformation decomposition. (2)
\textbf{Critique Agent} enhances reconstruction fidelity by identifying and
refining poor regions via multi-round MLLM-based reflection. (3) \textbf{Pose
Guider} enables motion generalization by generating expressive pose sequences
using time-aware parametric encoders. (4) \textbf{Video Harmonizer} synthesizes
photorealistic, coherent video via a hybrid rendering pipeline with diffusion,
refining the Reconstructor through a Back-to-4D feedback loop. HumanGenesis
achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks including text-guided synthesis,
video reenactment, and novel-pose generalization, significantly improving
expressiveness, geometric fidelity, and scene integration.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis and 4D reconstruction techniques predominantly rely on
RGB cameras, thereby inheriting inherent limitations such as the dependence on
adequate lighting, susceptibility to motion blur, and a limited dynamic range.
Event cameras, offering advantages of low power, high temporal resolution and
high dynamic range, have brought a new perspective to addressing the scene
reconstruction challenges in high-speed motion and low-light scenes. To this
end, we propose E-4DGS, the first event-driven dynamic Gaussian Splatting
approach, for novel view synthesis from multi-view event streams with
fast-moving cameras. Specifically, we introduce an event-based initialization
scheme to ensure stable training and propose event-adaptive slicing splatting
for time-aware reconstruction. Additionally, we employ intensity importance
pruning to eliminate floating artifacts and enhance 3D consistency, while
incorporating an adaptive contrast threshold for more precise optimization. We
design a synthetic multi-view camera setup with six moving event cameras
surrounding the object in a 360-degree configuration and provide a benchmark
multi-view event stream dataset that captures challenging motion scenarios. Our
approach outperforms both event-only and event-RGB fusion baselines and paves
the way for the exploration of multi-view event-based reconstruction as a novel
approach for rapid scene capture.

Abstract: Detection of face forgery videos remains a formidable challenge in the field
of digital forensics, especially the generalization to unseen datasets and
common perturbations. In this paper, we tackle this issue by leveraging the
synergy between audio and visual speech elements, embarking on a novel approach
through audio-visual speech representation learning. Our work is motivated by
the finding that audio signals, enriched with speech content, can provide
precise information effectively reflecting facial movements. To this end, we
first learn precise audio-visual speech representations on real videos via a
self-supervised masked prediction task, which encodes both local and global
semantic information simultaneously. Then, the derived model is directly
transferred to the forgery detection task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of
cross-dataset generalization and robustness, without the participation of any
fake video in model training. Code is available at

Abstract: Cell detection, segmentation and classification are essential for analyzing
tumor microenvironments (TME) on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides. Existing
methods suffer from poor performance on understudied cell types (rare or not

these shortcomings, we introduce HistoPLUS, a state-of-the-art model for cell
analysis, trained on a novel curated pan-cancer dataset of 108,722 nuclei
covering 13 cell types. In external validation across 4 independent cohorts,
HistoPLUS outperforms current state-of-the-art models in detection quality by
5.2% and overall F1 classification score by 23.7%, while using 5x fewer
parameters. Notably, HistoPLUS unlocks the study of 7 understudied cell types
and brings significant improvements on 8 of 13 cell types. Moreover, we show
that HistoPLUS robustly transfers to two oncology indications unseen during
training. To support broader TME biomarker research, we release the model

Conclusion: HTG模型在低资源HTR中具有潜力，但仍需进一步改进以优化其应用效果。

Abstract: The digitization of historical manuscripts presents significant challenges
for Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems, particularly when dealing with
small, author-specific collections that diverge from the training data
distributions. Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) techniques, which generate
synthetic data tailored to specific handwriting styles, offer a promising
solution to address these challenges. However, the effectiveness of various HTG
models in enhancing HTR performance, especially in low-resource transcription
settings, has not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we systematically
compare three state-of-the-art styled HTG models (representing the generative
adversarial, diffusion, and autoregressive paradigms for HTG) to assess their
impact on HTR fine-tuning. We analyze how visual and linguistic characteristics
of synthetic data influence fine-tuning outcomes and provide quantitative
guidelines for selecting the most effective HTG model. The results of our
analysis provide insights into the current capabilities of HTG methods and
highlight key areas for further improvement in their application to
low-resource HTR.

*Trevine Oorloff,Vishwanath Sindagi,Wele Gedara Chaminda Bandara,Ali Shafahi,Amin Ghiasi,Charan Prakash,Reza Ardekani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文展示了如何利用现成的Stable Diffusion模型实现视觉上下文学习（V-ICL），无需额外微调即可适应多种视觉任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLM）在自然语言处理（NLP）中展现了上下文学习（ICL）的潜力，但在计算机视觉任务中，现有方法需要专门训练或额外数据，限制了其通用性。本文旨在探索一种更通用的视觉上下文学习方法。

Method: 通过重新计算Stable Diffusion架构中自注意力层的注意力机制，显式地结合查询和示例提示之间的上下文关系。

Result: 该方法在六种视觉任务（如前景分割、目标检测等）中表现优异，例如在Pascal-5i数据集上，前景分割任务的mIoU分别比Visual Prompting和IMProv提高了8.9%和3.2%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，现成的Stable Diffusion模型可以通过简单的注意力机制调整实现高效的视觉上下文学习，且能通过集成多个提示进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) in natural language processing (NLP) have
demonstrated great potential for in-context learning (ICL) -- the ability to
leverage a few sets of example prompts to adapt to various tasks without having
to explicitly update the model weights. ICL has recently been explored for
computer vision tasks with promising early outcomes. These approaches involve
specialized training and/or additional data that complicate the process and
limit its generalizability. In this work, we show that off-the-shelf Stable
Diffusion models can be repurposed for visual in-context learning (V-ICL).
Specifically, we formulate an in-place attention re-computation within the
self-attention layers of the Stable Diffusion architecture that explicitly
incorporates context between the query and example prompts. Without any
additional fine-tuning, we show that this repurposed Stable Diffusion model is
able to adapt to six different tasks: foreground segmentation, single object
detection, semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, edge detection, and
colorization. For example, the proposed approach improves the mean intersection
over union (mIoU) for the foreground segmentation task on Pascal-5i dataset by
8.9% and 3.2% over recent methods such as Visual Prompting and IMProv,
respectively. Additionally, we show that the proposed method is able to
effectively leverage multiple prompts through ensembling to infer the task
better and further improve the performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动营养分析领域缺乏标准化评估方法和高质量数据集的问题。

Abstract: Progress in AI for automated nutritional analysis is critically hampered by
the lack of standardized evaluation methodologies and high-quality, real-world
benchmark datasets. To address this, we introduce three primary contributions.
First, we present the January Food Benchmark (JFB), a publicly available
collection of 1,000 food images with human-validated annotations. Second, we
detail a comprehensive benchmarking framework, including robust metrics and a
novel, application-oriented overall score designed to assess model performance
holistically. Third, we provide baseline results from both general-purpose
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and our own specialized model,
january/food-vision-v1. Our evaluation demonstrates that the specialized model
achieves an Overall Score of 86.2, a 12.1-point improvement over the
best-performing general-purpose configuration. This work offers the research
community a valuable new evaluation dataset and a rigorous framework to guide
and benchmark future developments in automated nutritional analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AST-n框架通过从中间噪声水平启动反向扩散并结合高阶ODE求解器，显著加速LDCT去噪，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT（LDCT）减少辐射但增加图像噪声，影响诊断信心，需高效去噪方法。

Method: 提出AST-n框架，结合中间噪声启动和高阶ODE求解器，减少采样步骤。

Result: AST-25在25步内实现PSNR>38dB和SSIM>0.95，推理时间从16秒降至1秒。

Conclusion: AST-n结合高阶采样器可实现快速LDCT重建，提升临床可行性。

Abstract: Low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols reduce radiation exposure but increase image
noise, compromising diagnostic confidence. Diffusion-based generative models
have shown promise for LDCT denoising by learning image priors and performing
iterative refinement. In this work, we introduce AST-n, an accelerated
inference framework that initiates reverse diffusion from intermediate noise
levels, and integrate high-order ODE solvers within conditioned models to
further reduce sampling steps. We evaluate two acceleration paradigms--AST-n
sampling and standard scheduling with high-order solvers -- on the Low Dose CT
Grand Challenge dataset, covering head, abdominal, and chest scans at 10-25 %
of standard dose. Conditioned models using only 25 steps (AST-25) achieve peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) above 38 dB and structural similarity index (SSIM)
above 0.95, closely matching standard baselines while cutting inference time
from ~16 seg to under 1 seg per slice. Unconditional sampling suffers
substantial quality loss, underscoring the necessity of conditioning. We also
assess DDIM inversion, which yields marginal PSNR gains at the cost of doubling
inference time, limiting its clinical practicality. Our results demonstrate
that AST-n with high-order samplers enables rapid LDCT reconstruction without
significant loss of image fidelity, advancing the feasibility of
diffusion-based methods in clinical workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LIA-X是一种新型可解释的肖像动画生成器，通过稀疏运动字典实现面部动态的精细控制，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在面部动态转移中缺乏精细控制和可解释性的问题。

Method: 采用自编码器模型，通过稀疏运动字典将面部动态分解为可解释因素，支持‘编辑-变形-渲染’策略。

Result: 在自重现和跨重现任务中表现优异，支持用户引导的图像和视频编辑。

Conclusion: LIA-X在面部动画生成中实现了更高的可控性和可解释性，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce LIA-X, a novel interpretable portrait animator designed to
transfer facial dynamics from a driving video to a source portrait with
fine-grained control. LIA-X is an autoencoder that models motion transfer as a
linear navigation of motion codes in latent space. Crucially, it incorporates a
novel Sparse Motion Dictionary that enables the model to disentangle facial
dynamics into interpretable factors. Deviating from previous 'warp-render'
approaches, the interpretability of the Sparse Motion Dictionary allows LIA-X
to support a highly controllable 'edit-warp-render' strategy, enabling precise
manipulation of fine-grained facial semantics in the source portrait. This
helps to narrow initial differences with the driving video in terms of pose and
expression. Moreover, we demonstrate the scalability of LIA-X by successfully
training a large-scale model with approximately 1 billion parameters on
extensive datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed method
outperforms previous approaches in both self-reenactment and cross-reenactment
tasks across several benchmarks. Additionally, the interpretable and
controllable nature of LIA-X supports practical applications such as
fine-grained, user-guided image and video editing, as well as 3D-aware portrait
video manipulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Story2Board是一个无需训练的框架，用于从自然语言生成富有表现力的故事板。它通过轻量级一致性框架解决了现有方法忽视视觉叙事关键要素的问题，并在生成多样且一致的故事板方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过于关注主体身份，忽略了空间构图、背景演变和叙事节奏等视觉叙事的关键方面。

Method: 引入了轻量级一致性框架，包括潜在面板锚定（保持角色一致性）和互惠注意力值混合（软融合视觉特征），并利用现成语言模型将自由故事转换为面板级提示。

Result: 在Rich Storyboard Benchmark上，Story2Board在布局多样性、背景叙事和一致性方面表现优异，并通过用户研究验证了其动态性、连贯性和叙事吸引力。

Conclusion: Story2Board能够生成更动态、连贯且叙事吸引力的故事板，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: We present Story2Board, a training-free framework for expressive storyboard
generation from natural language. Existing methods narrowly focus on subject
identity, overlooking key aspects of visual storytelling such as spatial
composition, background evolution, and narrative pacing. To address this, we
introduce a lightweight consistency framework composed of two components:
Latent Panel Anchoring, which preserves a shared character reference across
panels, and Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing, which softly blends visual
features between token pairs with strong reciprocal attention. Together, these
mechanisms enhance coherence without architectural changes or fine-tuning,
enabling state-of-the-art diffusion models to generate visually diverse yet
consistent storyboards. To structure generation, we use an off-the-shelf
language model to convert free-form stories into grounded panel-level prompts.
To evaluate, we propose the Rich Storyboard Benchmark, a suite of open-domain
narratives designed to assess layout diversity and background-grounded
storytelling, in addition to consistency. We also introduce a new Scene
Diversity metric that quantifies spatial and pose variation across storyboards.
Our qualitative and quantitative results, as well as a user study, show that
Story2Board produces more dynamic, coherent, and narratively engaging
storyboards than existing baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种元优化分类器（MOC），通过结合元学习器和多样化的分类器库，显著提升了少样本学习下的WSI分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的少样本学习方法在数据稀缺时表现不佳，需要一种更鲁棒的方法来优化分类器配置。

Method: MOC包含一个元学习器和一个分类器库，前者自动优化分类器配置，后者提供多样化的候选分类器。

Result: 在多个少样本基准测试中，MOC表现优于现有方法，特别是在TCGA-NSCLC基准上，AUC提升了10.4%。

Conclusion: MOC为临床部署中数据稀缺的问题提供了重要解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in histopathology vision-language foundation models (VLFMs)
have shown promise in addressing data scarcity for whole slide image (WSI)
classification via zero-shot adaptation. However, these methods remain
outperformed by conventional multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches
trained on large datasets, motivating recent efforts to enhance VLFM-based WSI
classification through fewshot learning paradigms. While existing few-shot
methods improve diagnostic accuracy with limited annotations, their reliance on
conventional classifier designs introduces critical vulnerabilities to data
scarcity. To address this problem, we propose a Meta-Optimized Classifier (MOC)
comprising two core components: (1) a meta-learner that automatically optimizes
a classifier configuration from a mixture of candidate classifiers and (2) a
classifier bank housing diverse candidate classifiers to enable a holistic
pathological interpretation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOC
outperforms prior arts in multiple few-shot benchmarks. Notably, on the
TCGA-NSCLC benchmark, MOC improves AUC by 10.4% over the state-of-the-art
few-shot VLFM-based methods, with gains up to 26.25% under 1-shot conditions,
offering a critical advancement for clinical deployments where diagnostic
training data is severely limited. Code is available at

TL;DR: PERSONA框架结合3D和扩散方法，从单张图像生成个性化3D人体化身，解决身份保持和姿态驱动的变形问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D方法需要大量姿态丰富的视频，而扩散方法难以保持身份和解决姿态依赖的身份纠缠问题。

Method: PERSONA利用扩散方法从输入图像生成姿态丰富的视频，并通过平衡采样和几何加权优化优化3D化身。

Result: 实现了从单张图像生成高质量、姿态驱动的3D人体化身，身份保持和渲染质量优异。

Conclusion: PERSONA结合两种方法的优势，为个性化3D化身提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Two major approaches exist for creating animatable human avatars. The first,
a 3D-based approach, optimizes a NeRF- or 3DGS-based avatar from videos of a
single person, achieving personalization through a disentangled identity
representation. However, modeling pose-driven deformations, such as non-rigid
cloth deformations, requires numerous pose-rich videos, which are costly and
impractical to capture in daily life. The second, a diffusion-based approach,
learns pose-driven deformations from large-scale in-the-wild videos but
struggles with identity preservation and pose-dependent identity entanglement.
We present PERSONA, a framework that combines the strengths of both approaches
to obtain a personalized 3D human avatar with pose-driven deformations from a
single image. PERSONA leverages a diffusion-based approach to generate
pose-rich videos from the input image and optimizes a 3D avatar based on them.
To ensure high authenticity and sharp renderings across diverse poses, we
introduce balanced sampling and geometry-weighted optimization. Balanced
sampling oversamples the input image to mitigate identity shifts in
diffusion-generated training videos. Geometry-weighted optimization prioritizes
geometry constraints over image loss, preserving rendering quality in diverse
poses.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful alternative
to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for 3D scene representation, offering
high-fidelity photorealistic rendering with real-time performance. Beyond novel

NeRF-based methods that inform their 3DGS counterparts. We then categorize 3DGS
applications into segmentation, editing, generation, and other functional
tasks. For each, we summarize representative methods, supervision strategies,
and learning paradigms, highlighting shared design principles and emerging
trends. Commonly used datasets and evaluation protocols are also summarized,
along with comparative analyses of recent methods across public benchmarks. To

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（VLM）因计算和内存需求高而受限，现有压缩方法存在模块不可比、任务单一和技术孤立的问题。

Method: 提出LLMC+基准工具包，支持多种算法，系统研究令牌级和模型级压缩。

Result: 发现空间和时间冗余需不同策略，多任务中表现下降，结合压缩技术效果更佳。

Conclusion: LLMC+为公平评估和高效VLM研究提供支持。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive multi-modal
capabilities but suffer from prohibitive computational and memory demands, due
to their long visual token sequences and massive parameter sizes. To address
these issues, recent works have proposed training-free compression methods.
However, existing efforts often suffer from three major limitations: (1)
Current approaches do not decompose techniques into comparable modules,
hindering fair evaluation across spatial and temporal redundancy. (2)
Evaluation confined to simple single-turn tasks, failing to reflect performance
in realistic scenarios. (3) Isolated use of individual compression techniques,
without exploring their joint potential. To overcome these gaps, we introduce
LLMC+, a comprehensive VLM compression benchmark with a versatile,
plug-and-play toolkit. LLMC+ supports over 20 algorithms across five
representative VLM families and enables systematic study of token-level and
model-level compression. Our benchmark reveals that: (1) Spatial and temporal
redundancies demand distinct technical strategies. (2) Token reduction methods
degrade significantly in multi-turn dialogue and detail-sensitive tasks. (3)
Combining token and model compression achieves extreme compression with minimal
performance loss. We believe LLMC+ will facilitate fair evaluation and inspire
future research in efficient VLM. Our code is available at

TL;DR: ParallelSearch是一种新型强化学习框架，通过并行处理查询提升搜索代理的效率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有搜索代理在处理查询时采用严格串行方式，限制了计算效率，尤其是需要多实体比较的查询。

Method: 提出ParallelSearch框架，利用强化学习激励LLM识别并行查询结构并执行并行搜索操作。

Result: 在七个问答基准测试中平均性能提升2.9%，并行问题性能提升12.7%，且LLM调用减少30.4%。

Conclusion: ParallelSearch通过并行化显著提升了搜索代理的效率和性能。

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented search agents such as Search-R1, trained via
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in multi-step information retrieval from external knowledge
sources. These agents address the limitations of their parametric memory by
dynamically gathering relevant facts to address complex reasoning tasks.
However, existing approaches suffer from a fundamental architectural
limitation: they process search queries strictly sequentially, even when
handling inherently parallelizable and logically independent comparisons. This
sequential bottleneck significantly constrains computational efficiency,
particularly for queries that require multiple entity comparisons. To address
this critical limitation, we propose ParallelSearch, a novel reinforcement
learning framework that empowers large language models (LLMs) to recognize
parallelizable query structures and execute multiple search operations
concurrently. Our approach introduces dedicated reward functions that
incentivize the identification of independent query components while preserving
answer accuracy through jointly considering correctness, query decomposition
quality, and parallel execution benefits. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that ParallelSearch outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average
performance gain of 2.9% across seven question-answering benchmarks. Notably,
on parallelizable questions, our method achieves a 12.7% performance
improvement while requiring only 69.6% of the LLM calls compared to sequential
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见疾病领域的NER面临标注数据稀缺、语义模糊和长尾分布等挑战，需要探索高效的低资源解决方案。

Method: 采用多种提示策略（零样本、少样本、RAG和任务级微调），设计结构化提示框架，并引入语义引导的少样本选择方法。

Result: GPT-4o在RareDis Corpus上表现优于BioClinicalBERT，任务级微调达到SOTA。少样本提示在低成本下效果显著，RAG收益有限。

Conclusion: 优化提示的大型语言模型（LLM）可作为罕见疾病NER中传统监督模型的有效替代方案，尤其在标注数据稀缺时。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in the rare disease domain poses unique
challenges due to limited labeled data, semantic ambiguity between entity
types, and long-tail distributions. In this study, we evaluate the capabilities
of GPT-4o for rare disease NER under low-resource settings, using a range of
prompt-based strategies including zero-shot prompting, few-shot in-context
learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and task-level fine-tuning. We
design a structured prompting framework that encodes domain-specific knowledge
and disambiguation rules for four entity types. We further introduce two
semantically guided few-shot example selection methods to improve in-context
performance while reducing labeling effort. Experiments on the RareDis Corpus
show that GPT-4o achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
BioClinicalBERT, with task-level fine-tuning yielding new state-of-the-art
(SOTA) results. Cost-performance analysis reveals that few-shot prompting
delivers high returns at low token budgets, while RAG offers marginal
additional benefit. An error taxonomy highlights common failure modes such as
boundary drift and type confusion, suggesting opportunities for post-processing
and hybrid refinement. Our results demonstrate that prompt-optimized LLMs can
serve as effective, scalable alternatives to traditional supervised models in
biomedical NER, particularly in rare disease applications where annotated data
is scarce.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从半结构化文本中提取表格数据具有挑战性，尤其是当文本缺乏一致的分隔符时。纯神经方法因幻觉和无法强制约束而表现不佳。

Method: TEN采用结构分解提示法生成初始表格，并通过符号检查器评估其完整性和检测幻觉，再通过批判性LLM生成修正指导，形成自调试循环。

Result: 实验表明，TEN在多个数据集和指标上显著优于纯神经基线，准确率更高且幻觉率更低。用户研究也证实其表格更准确且更易验证。

Conclusion: TEN通过神经符号结合的方法，有效解决了表格提取中的挑战，并在实际应用中表现出优越性。

Abstract: We present a neurosymbolic approach, TEN, for extracting tabular data from
semistructured input text. This task is particularly challenging for text input
that does not use special delimiters consistently to separate columns and rows.
Purely neural approaches perform poorly due to hallucinations and their
inability to enforce hard constraints. TEN uses Structural Decomposition
prompting - a specialized chain-of-thought prompting approach - on a large
language model (LLM) to generate an initial table, and thereafter uses a
symbolic checker to evaluate not only the well-formedness of that table, but
also detect cases of hallucinations or forgetting. The output of the symbolic
checker is processed by a critique-LLM to generate guidance for fixing the
table, which is presented to the original LLM in a self-debug loop. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that TEN significantly outperforms purely
neural baselines across multiple datasets and metrics, achieving significantly
higher exact match accuracy and substantially reduced hallucination rates. A
21-participant user study further confirms that TEN's tables are rated
significantly more accurate (mean score: 5.0 vs 4.3; p = 0.021), and are
consistently preferred for ease of verification and correction, with
participants favoring our method in over 60% of the cases.

Motivation: 传统神经影像方法成本高且受限，而数字文本为情感-大脑映射提供了新途径。现有研究缺乏将神经影像与文本分析的整合。

Method: 使用OpenAI的文本嵌入模型生成语义表示，通过降维和聚类识别情感组，并将其映射到18个与情感处理相关的大脑区域。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法具有高空间特异性，能区分临床人群（如抑郁症患者），并评估AI生成文本的情感表达。

Conclusion: 该方法成本低、可扩展，为大规模自然语言分析和AI情感表达评估提供了大脑基准。

Abstract: Understanding how emotional expression in language relates to brain function
is a challenge in computational neuroscience and affective computing.
Traditional neuroimaging is costly and lab-bound, but abundant digital text
offers new avenues for emotion-brain mapping. Prior work has largely examined
neuroimaging-based emotion localization or computational text analysis
separately, with little integration. We propose a computational framework that
maps textual emotional content to anatomically defined brain regions without
requiring neuroimaging. Using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002, we generate
high-dimensional semantic representations, apply dimensionality reduction and
clustering to identify emotional groups, and map them to 18 brain regions
linked to emotional processing. Three experiments were conducted: i) analyzing
conversational data from healthy vs. depressed subjects (DIAC-WOZ dataset) to
compare mapping patterns, ii) applying the method to the GoEmotions dataset and
iii) comparing human-written text with large language model (LLM) responses to
assess differences in inferred brain activation. Emotional intensity was scored
via lexical analysis. Results showed neuroanatomically plausible mappings with
high spatial specificity. Depressed subjects exhibited greater limbic
engagement tied to negative affect. Discrete emotions were successfully
differentiated. LLM-generated text matched humans in basic emotion distribution
but lacked nuanced activation in empathy and self-referential regions (medial
prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex). This cost-effective, scalable
approach enables large-scale analysis of naturalistic language, distinguishes
between clinical populations, and offers a brain-based benchmark for evaluating
AI emotional expression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统共识方法（如德尔菲研究）存在专家负担重、信息过载等问题，需要更高效且灵活的方法。

Method: HAH-Delphi框架整合AI模型、专家小组和结构化引导，分三阶段测试：复现、比较和应用部署。

Result: AI复现95%共识结论，与专家方向一致率达95%，小型专家小组达成>90%共识覆盖率。

Conclusion: HAH-Delphi框架高效、灵活，适用于多领域，支持个性化共识生成。

Abstract: Expert consensus plays a critical role in domains where evidence is complex,
conflicting, or insufficient for direct prescription. Traditional methods, such
as Delphi studies, consensus conferences, and systematic guideline synthesis,
offer structure but face limitations including high panel burden, interpretive
oversimplification, and suppression of conditional nuance. These challenges are
now exacerbated by information overload, fragmentation of the evidence base,
and increasing reliance on publicly available sources that lack expert
filtering. This study introduces and evaluates a Human-AI Hybrid Delphi
(HAH-Delphi) framework designed to augment expert consensus development by
integrating a generative AI model (Gemini 2.5 Pro), small panels of senior
human experts, and structured facilitation. The HAH-Delphi was tested in three
phases: retrospective replication, prospective comparison, and applied
deployment in two applied domains (endurance training and resistance and mixed
cardio/strength training). The AI replicated 95% of published expert consensus
conclusions in Phase I and showed 95% directional agreement with senior human
experts in Phase II, though it lacked experiential and pragmatic nuance. In
Phase III, compact panels of six senior experts achieved >90% consensus
coverage and reached thematic saturation before the final participant. The AI
provided consistent, literature-grounded scaffolding that supported divergence
resolution and accelerated saturation. The HAH-Delphi framework offers a
flexible, scalable approach for generating high-quality, context-sensitive
consensus. Its successful application across health, coaching, and performance
science confirms its methodological robustness and supports its use as a
foundation for generating conditional, personalised guidance and published
consensus frameworks at scale.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种联合建模语言和声学信息的文本无关语音模型，通过生成语义标记和连续声学帧表示，改进了现有模型在声学细节上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本无关语音模型仅预测语义标记，依赖外部声码器添加声学信息，缺乏声学上下文和控制能力。

Method: 使用流匹配目标预测连续声学向量，并研究多语义标记预测以保留语言信息。

Result: 在语言似然基准测试中表现与现有模型相当，同时在提示生成中提供更好的声学细节。

Conclusion: 联合建模语言和声学信息的方法在保持语言性能的同时，提升了声学细节的表现。

Abstract: Textless spoken language models (SLMs) are generative models of speech that
do not rely on text supervision. Most textless SLMs learn to predict the next
semantic token, a discrete representation of linguistic content, and rely on a
separate vocoder to add acoustic information to the generated speech. Such
models have no access to acoustic context and no built-in control over acoustic
details. In this work, we propose to jointly model linguistic and acoustic
information by generating semantic tokens and a continuous real-valued
representation of the acoustic frame. We use a flow-matching objective to
predict the continuous vector conditioned on the semantic tokens. We study the
design space of this approach and find that predicting multiple future semantic
tokens helps preserve linguistic information. Our approach achieves comparable
performance to existing models in terms of linguistic likelihood benchmarks,
while providing better acoustic detail in prompted generation.

Result: APIO在语法错误纠正和文本简化任务上取得了纯LLM提示方法的最新性能。

Conclusion: APIO是一种简单有效的自动提示优化方法，为相关任务提供了新的解决方案，并公开了数据、代码和提示。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range
of natural language processing (NLP) tasks to be performed through simple
prompt-based interactions. Consequently, several approaches have been proposed
to engineer prompts that most effectively enable LLMs to perform a given task
(e.g., chain-of-thought prompting). In settings with a well-defined metric to
optimize model performance, automatic prompt optimization (APO) methods have
been developed to refine a seed prompt. Advancing this line of research, we
propose APIO, a simple but effective prompt induction and optimization approach
for the tasks of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) and Text Simplification,
without relying on manually specified seed prompts. APIO achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance for purely LLM-based prompting methods on these
tasks. We make our data, code, prompts, and outputs publicly available.

problem arises in enterprises, domain sciences, government agencies, and more.
In this paper we make three contributions that significantly advances the state

chain-of-thought reasoning, and token-level analysis. Extensive experiments
show that Columbo significantly outperforms NameGuess, the current most
advanced solution, by 4-29\%, over 5 datasets. Columbo has been used in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决双语环境中儿童导向语音的语言识别挑战，尤其是语言不平衡问题。

Method: 利用Zipformer的内部层编码语言特征，并比较不同后端的效果。

Result: 在语言识别任务中，平衡准确率达到81.89%，比基线提升15.47%。

Conclusion: Zipformer在真实场景中表现出色，展现了Transformer编码器架构的潜力。

Abstract: Code-switching and language identification in child-directed scenarios
present significant challenges, particularly in bilingual environments. This
paper addresses this challenge by using Zipformer to handle the nuances of
speech, which contains two imbalanced languages, Mandarin and English, in an
utterance. This work demonstrates that the internal layers of the Zipformer
effectively encode the language characteristics, which can be leveraged in
language identification. We present the selection methodology of the inner
layers to extract the embeddings and make a comparison with different
back-ends. Our analysis shows that Zipformer is robust across these backends.
Our approach effectively handles imbalanced data, achieving a Balanced Accuracy
(BAC) of 81.89%, a 15.47% improvement over the language identification
baseline. These findings highlight the potential of the transformer encoder
architecture model in real scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图表摘要任务自动化存在潜在偏见问题，可能对社会造成危害，因此需要研究VLMs中的地理经济偏见。

Method: 通过6,000个图表-国家对的大规模评估，分析不同VLMs生成的摘要中因国家经济地位导致的情感差异，并尝试提示去偏见方法。

Result: 现有VLMs对高收入国家的描述更积极，且去偏见方法效果有限。

Conclusion: 地理经济偏见问题复杂，需更鲁棒的去偏见策略。

Abstract: Charts are very common for exploring data and communicating insights, but
extracting key takeaways from charts and articulating them in natural language
can be challenging. The chart-to-text task aims to automate this process by
generating textual summaries of charts. While with the rapid advancement of
large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we have witnessed great progress in this
domain, little to no attention has been given to potential biases in their
outputs. This paper investigates how VLMs can amplify geo-economic biases when
generating chart summaries, potentially causing societal harm. Specifically, we
conduct a large-scale evaluation of geo-economic biases in VLM-generated chart
summaries across 6,000 chart-country pairs from six widely used proprietary and
open-source models to understand how a country's economic status influences the
sentiment of generated summaries. Our analysis reveals that existing VLMs tend
to produce more positive descriptions for high-income countries compared to
middle- or low-income countries, even when country attribution is the only
variable changed. We also find that models such as GPT-4o-mini,
Gemini-1.5-Flash, and Phi-3.5 exhibit varying degrees of bias. We further
explore inference-time prompt-based debiasing techniques using positive
distractors but find them only partially effective, underscoring the complexity
of the issue and the need for more robust debiasing strategies. Our code and
dataset are publicly available here.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型基准主要关注可验证任务，难以满足用户个性化需求，因此需要一种基于用户偏好的动态评估方法。

Method: 通过分析超过10K条主观查询数据，提出可定制的奖励模型（CRMs），仅需4B参数即可超越GPT-4.1和Gemini-2.5-pro等领先模型。

Result: CRMs表现出卓越的泛化能力，USL在多样化偏好场景中展现出强负相关性。

Conclusion: USL和CRMs为用户提供了更灵活、个性化的模型选择工具，弥补了现有基准的不足。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) predominantely focus on
assessing their capabilities through verifiable tasks. Such objective and
static benchmarks offer limited utility for practical LLM selection, making it
difficult for users to find suitable models for their individual needs. To
bridge this gap, we present the first User-Centric Subjective Leaderboard
(USL), which provides a preference-driven, dynamic ranking of LLMs across
diverse real-world scenarios. Our work is built upon a thorough investigation
of real human preference data, involving more than 10K subjective queries. Our
investigation reveals significant diversity and contradictions in human
preferences, which limit the effectiveness of state-of-the-art reward models.
To address this, we introduce Customizable Reward Models (CRMs). With only 4B
parameters, our CRM surpasses the performance of leading models such as GPT-4.1
and Gemini-2.5-pro, showing exceptional generalization capabilities across new
topics and criteria. The USL, powered by CRMs, exhibits strong negative
correlations to contradictory preferences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在学习和回忆知识时的不稳定性问题，提供一种可靠的方法来确保模型学习特定知识体系。

Method: 采用“主动阅读”框架，训练模型通过自生成的学习策略研究给定材料。

Result: 在专家领域测试中，主动阅读显著优于传统微调和其他数据增强方法，例如在SimpleQA和FinanceBench上的表现分别提升了313%和160%。

Conclusion: 主动阅读不仅在小规模训练中有效，还能应用于预训练阶段，构建更具事实性的模型，如发布的Meta WikiExpert-8B在事实问答任务中表现优异。

Abstract: LLMs are known to store vast amounts of knowledge in their parametric memory.
However, learning and recalling facts from this memory is known to be
unreliable, depending largely on the prevalence of particular facts in the
training data and other factors which are poorly understood. Practitioners are
lacking tools which will allow them to ensure that the models learn a given
body of knowledge reliably and consistently. To this end, we propose Active
Reading: a framework where we train models to study a given set of material
with self-generated learning strategies. First, we demonstrate models trained
with Active Reading on expert domains absorb significantly more knowledge than
vanilla finetuning and other data augmentations. We train expert 8B models that
achieve 66% on a Wikipedia-grounded subset of SimpleQA (+313% relative over
vanilla finetuning) and 26% on FinanceBench (+160% relative over vanilla
finetuning) by applying Active Reading to the source documents for each
benchmark. Finally, we show that Active Reading can be utilized at pre-training
scale to build more factual models. As a demonstration of this, we release Meta
WikiExpert-8B, a Wikipedia-expert model trained on 1 trillion generated tokens,
which outcompetes models with hundreds of billions of parameters on factual QA.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态段落选择器（DPS），用于解决检索增强生成（RAG）系统中传统重排模块在多跳查询中的局限性。DPS通过监督学习动态选择相关段落，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统的重排模块在多跳查询中表现不佳，固定Top-K选择方法无法平衡信息遗漏和噪声引入的问题。

Method: DPS是一种新型重排框架，将段落选择视为监督学习问题，捕捉段落间依赖关系并动态选择最相关段落。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，DPS均优于现有方法，尤其在MuSiQue数据集上F1分数提升30.06%和15.4%。

Conclusion: DPS通过自适应证据选择显著提升了复杂RAG场景中的推理能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are often bottlenecked by their
reranking modules, which typically score passages independently and select a
fixed Top-K size. This approach struggles with complex multi-hop queries that
require synthesizing evidence across multiple documents, creating a trade-off
where small K values omit crucial information and large K values introduce
noise. To address this, we introduce the Dynamic Passage Selector (DPS), a
novel reranking framework that treats passage selection as a supervised
learning problem. Unlike traditional point-wise or list-wise methods, DPS is
fine-tuned to capture inter-passage dependencies and dynamically select the
most relevant set of passages for generation. As a seamless plug-and-play
module, DPS requires no modifications to the standard RAG pipeline.
Comprehensive evaluations on five benchmarks show that DPS consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art rerankers and fine-tuning methods. Notably, on the
challenging MuSiQue dataset, DPS improves the F1-score by 30.06% and 15.4% over
strong baselines like Qwen3-reranker and RankingGPT, respectively. Our results
demonstrate that by enabling adaptive evidence selection, DPS substantially
enhances reasoning capabilities in complex RAG scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨语言ABSA方法依赖翻译工具，但其可靠性不足。本文旨在通过LLM生成伪标签数据，避免翻译工具的局限性。

Method: 1. 训练ABSA模型预测目标语言数据；2. 用LLM生成更自然的伪标签句子；3. 基于伪标签数据进一步微调ABSA模型。

Result: 在六种语言和五种骨干模型上验证，性能超越现有基于翻译的方法，且微调后的LLM优于小型多语言模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了跨语言ABSA中翻译工具的依赖问题，展示了LLM在生成高质量伪标签数据方面的潜力。

Abstract: Cross-lingual aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) involves detailed
sentiment analysis in a target language by transferring knowledge from a source
language with available annotated data. Most existing methods depend heavily on
often unreliable translation tools to bridge the language gap. In this paper,
we propose a new approach that leverages a large language model (LLM) to
generate high-quality pseudo-labelled data in the target language without the
need for translation tools. First, the framework trains an ABSA model to obtain
predictions for unlabelled target language data. Next, LLM is prompted to
generate natural sentences that better represent these noisy predictions than
the original text. The ABSA model is then further fine-tuned on the resulting
pseudo-labelled dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method across
six languages and five backbone models, surpassing previous state-of-the-art
translation-based approaches. The proposed framework also supports generative
models, and we show that fine-tuned LLMs outperform smaller multilingual
models.

Result: 综述了跨语言ABSA的研究进展，并指出其在多语言和LLM背景下的贡献。

Conclusion: 跨语言ABSA仍面临挑战，未来研究需进一步探索以提升系统性能。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment analysis
task that focuses on understanding opinions at the aspect level, including
sentiment towards specific aspect terms, categories, and opinions. While ABSA
research has seen significant progress, much of the focus has been on
monolingual settings. Cross-lingual ABSA, which aims to transfer knowledge from
resource-rich languages (such as English) to low-resource languages, remains an
under-explored area, with no systematic review of the field. This paper aims to
fill that gap by providing a comprehensive survey of cross-lingual ABSA. We
summarize key ABSA tasks, including aspect term extraction, aspect sentiment
classification, and compound tasks involving multiple sentiment elements.
Additionally, we review the datasets, modelling paradigms, and cross-lingual
transfer methods used to solve these tasks. We also examine how existing work
in monolingual and multilingual ABSA, as well as ABSA with LLMs, contributes to
the development of cross-lingual ABSA. Finally, we highlight the main
challenges and suggest directions for future research to advance cross-lingual
ABSA systems.

Abstract: Emotional support conversations are crucial for promoting emotional
well-being, yet current models often lack deep empathetic reasoning grounded in
psychological principles. To address this, we propose controllable empathetic
reasoning, which combines natural language reasoning with structured
psychological steps. We construct a fine-grained dataset annotated with
reasoning correctness and response preferences to enable this capability. To
further enhance training, we employ reinforcement learning with a unified
process-outcome reward model that delivers precise feedback. To mitigate
response repetitiveness from entropy collapse, we introduce personality-based
dialogue rewriting and a redundancy-aware reward reweighting strategy. Our
approach significantly improves model's emotional support ability, advancing
the development of empathetic, human-like support systems.

Method: 提出N-Gram Coverage Attack，通过获取目标模型在候选成员前缀条件下的多个生成文本，利用n-gram重叠度量计算这些输出与真实后缀的相似性，高相似性表明成员可能性。

Result: 该方法在现有基准测试中优于其他黑盒方法，甚至媲美白盒攻击。攻击性能随生成序列数量增加而提升。实验还发现，较新模型（如GPT-4）对成员推理攻击更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: N-Gram Coverage Attack是一种高效的黑盒成员推理攻击方法，适用于广泛使用的API模型。研究还揭示了模型在隐私保护方面的进步趋势。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks serves as useful tool for fair use of language
models, such as detecting potential copyright infringement and auditing data
leakage. However, many current state-of-the-art attacks require access to
models' hidden states or probability distribution, which prevents investigation
into more widely-used, API-access only models like GPT-4. In this work, we
introduce N-Gram Coverage Attack, a membership inference attack that relies
solely on text outputs from the target model, enabling attacks on completely
black-box models. We leverage the observation that models are more likely to
memorize and subsequently generate text patterns that were commonly observed in
their training data. Specifically, to make a prediction on a candidate member,
N-Gram Coverage Attack first obtains multiple model generations conditioned on
a prefix of the candidate. It then uses n-gram overlap metrics to compute and
aggregate the similarities of these outputs with the ground truth suffix; high
similarities indicate likely membership. We first demonstrate on a diverse set
of existing benchmarks that N-Gram Coverage Attack outperforms other black-box
methods while also impressively achieving comparable or even better performance
to state-of-the-art white-box attacks - despite having access to only text
outputs. Interestingly, we find that the success rate of our method scales with
the attack compute budget - as we increase the number of sequences generated
from the target model conditioned on the prefix, attack performance tends to
improve. Having verified the accuracy of our method, we use it to investigate
previously unstudied closed OpenAI models on multiple domains. We find that
more recent models, such as GPT-4o, exhibit increased robustness to membership
inference, suggesting an evolving trend toward improved privacy protections.

particularly in scientific publishing and multilingual contexts where detection
resources are often limited. To address this critical gap, we introduce the
AINL-Eval 2025 Shared Task, specifically focused on the detection of
AI-generated scientific abstracts in Russian. We present a novel, large-scale
dataset comprising 52,305 samples, including human-written abstracts across 12
diverse scientific domains and AI-generated counterparts from five
state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4-Turbo, Gemma2-27B, Llama3.3-70B, Deepseek-V3, and
GigaChat-Lite). A core objective of the task is to challenge participants to
develop robust solutions capable of generalizing to both (i) previously unseen
scientific domains and (ii) models not included in the training data. The task
was organized in two phases, attracting 10 teams and 159 submissions, with top
systems demonstrating strong performance in identifying AI-generated content.
We also establish a continuous shared task platform to foster ongoing research

Abstract: Increasing diversity in language models is a challenging yet essential
objective. A common approach is to raise the decoding temperature. In this
work, we investigate this approach through a simplistic yet common case to
provide insights into why decreasing temperature can improve quality
(Precision), while increasing it often fails to boost coverage (Recall). Our
analysis reveals that for a model to be effectively tunable through temperature
adjustments, it must be trained toward coverage. To address this, we propose
rethinking loss functions in language models by leveraging the Precision-Recall
framework. Our results demonstrate that this approach achieves a substantially
better trade-off between Precision and Recall than merely combining negative
log-likelihood training with temperature scaling. These findings offer a

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EffiEval是一种无需训练的高效基准测试方法，通过自适应选择代表性数据子集，解决了大语言模型评估中的数据冗余问题，同时保持高可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展和评估基准的多样化，传统评估方法面临计算挑战，EffiEval旨在高效、公平且可靠地评估模型性能。

Method: 基于模型效用指数（MUI）自适应选择高质量代表性数据子集，满足代表性、公平性和通用性要求。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中，EffiEval仅用少量数据即可实现与全数据集评估一致的排名结果。

Conclusion: EffiEval为大语言模型时代提供了一种灵活、可扩展且高效的评估解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and the development of
increasingly large and diverse evaluation benchmarks have introduced
substantial computational challenges for model assessment. In this paper, we
present EffiEval, a training-free approach for efficient benchmarking that
effectively addresses data redundancy while maintaining high evaluation
reliability. Our method is specifically designed to meet three key criteria for
high-quality evaluation: representativeness, by ensuring comprehensive coverage
of model capabilities; fairness, by remaining independent of model performance
during sample selection to avoid bias; and generalizability, by enabling
flexible transfer across datasets and model families without reliance on
large-scale evaluation data. Unlike traditional methods that rely on absolute
performance or require extensive evaluation data, our approach adaptively
selects high-quality representative subsets based on the Model Utility Index
(MUI). Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks and diverse LLMs
demonstrate that EffiEval achieves strong ranking consistency with full-dataset
evaluation using only a small fraction of the original data. Furthermore, our
method is flexible and scalable in size, allowing users to balance evaluation
efficiency and representativeness according to specific needs. Overall,
EffiEval provides a practical and generalizable solution for reliable, fair,
and efficient evaluation in the era of LLMs.

*Ziyang Ma,Qingyue Yuan,Linhai Zhang,Deyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SLowED的安全蒸馏方法，通过Slow Tuning和Low-Entropy Masking模块，在提升小型语言模型（SLM）推理能力的同时保持其安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有链式思维（CoT）蒸馏方法在提升SLM推理能力时忽视了其对模型安全性的负面影响，而现有安全对齐方法需要额外计算或标注数据，可能影响推理能力。

Method: 提出SLowED方法，包含Slow Tuning（缩小权重变化幅度以优化初始权重附近空间）和Low-Entropy Masking（屏蔽低熵标记以避免不必要的学习）。

Result: 实验表明，SLowED在保持SLM安全性的同时，推理能力优于现有蒸馏方法。消融研究验证了Slow Tuning和Low-Entropy Masking的有效性。

Conclusion: SLowED是一种高效且安全的蒸馏方法，适用于提升SLM的推理能力而不损害安全性。

Abstract: Previous chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation methods primarily focused on
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Small Language Models (SLMs) by
utilizing high-quality rationales generated by powerful Large Language Models
(LLMs, e.g., GPT-4). However, few works have noted the negative effects on SLM
safety brought by the training, which are revealed in this study. Although
there are works on safety alignment that fine-tune language models or
manipulate model weights to defend against harmful inputs, they require extra
computation or annotated data, and probably impact the reasoning ability of
SLMs. In this paper, we investigate how to maintain the safety of SLMs during
the CoT distillation process. Specifically, we propose a safe distillation
method, Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking Distillation (SLowED), containing
two modules: Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking. Slow Tuning scales down the
magnitude of model weight changes to optimize the model weights in the
neighboring space near the initial weight distribution. Low-Entropy Masking
masks low-entropy tokens, which are regarded as unnecessary learning targets,
to exclude them from fine-tuning. Experiments on three SLMs (Qwen2.5-1.5B,
Llama-3.2-1B, BLOOM-1.1B) across reasoning benchmarks (BBH, BB-Sub, ARC,
AGIEval) and safety evaluation (AdvBench) show that SLowED retains the safety
of SLMs and comparably improves their reasoning capability compared to existing
distillation methods. Furthermore, our ablation study presents the
effectiveness of Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking, with the former
maintaining the model's safety in the early stage and the latter prolonging the
safe training epochs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI在法律职业中的潜力，特别是LLM在关键法律任务中的表现。

Method: 通过调查实验，比较LLM与初级律师的输出，并由高级法律学生评估其帮助性、准确性和全面性。

Result: LLM在法律起草和问题识别上表现优异，但在专业研究和推理中常产生错误或虚构内容。

Conclusion: LLM可辅助部分法律任务，但人类专业知识在复杂推理和法律精确应用上仍不可或缺。

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence(AI) into the legal profession
raises significant questions about the capacity of Large Language Models(LLM)
to perform key legal tasks. In this paper, I empirically evaluate how well
LLMs, such as GPT, Claude, and Llama, perform key legal tasks in the Indian
context, including issue spotting, legal drafting, advice, research, and
reasoning. Through a survey experiment, I compare outputs from LLMs with those
of a junior lawyer, with advanced law students rating the work on helpfulness,
accuracy, and comprehensiveness. LLMs excel in drafting and issue spotting,
often matching or surpassing human work. However, they struggle with
specialised legal research, frequently generating hallucinations, factually
incorrect or fabricated outputs. I conclude that while LLMs can augment certain
legal tasks, human expertise remains essential for nuanced reasoning and the
precise application of law.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了视觉语言模型（VLMs）对误导性可视化设计的敏感性，发现大多数模型容易被欺骗，导致对图表的错误解读。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着VLMs被广泛用于解读可视化数据，尤其是非专业用户，了解这些模型对误导性设计的敏感性至关重要。

Method: 通过分析10种不同模型对8种误导性图表设计的16,000多个响应，评估VLMs的解读能力。

Result: 大多数VLMs被误导性设计欺骗，导致对相同数据的错误解读。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在VLMs中建立防止视觉误导的鲁棒性保障措施的必要性。

Abstract: Information visualizations are powerful tools that help users quickly
identify patterns, trends, and outliers, facilitating informed decision-making.
However, when visualizations incorporate deceptive design elements-such as
truncated or inverted axes, unjustified 3D effects, or violations of best
practices-they can mislead viewers and distort understanding, spreading
misinformation. While some deceptive tactics are obvious, others subtly
manipulate perception while maintaining a facade of legitimacy. As
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used to interpret
visualizations, especially by non-expert users, it is critical to understand
how susceptible these models are to deceptive visual designs. In this study, we
conduct an in-depth evaluation of VLMs' ability to interpret misleading
visualizations. By analyzing over 16,000 responses from ten different models
across eight distinct types of misleading chart designs, we demonstrate that
most VLMs are deceived by them. This leads to altered interpretations of
charts, despite the underlying data remaining the same. Our findings highlight
the need for robust safeguards in VLMs against visual misinformation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GFPO（Group Filtered Policy Optimization）通过训练时采样更多组数据并基于响应长度和令牌效率过滤响应，有效减少语言模型因追求准确性而导致的冗余文本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在强化学习中倾向于通过增加响应长度来提高准确性，导致大量冗余文本。GFPO旨在解决这一问题，优化模型效率。

Method: GFPO在训练时采样更多组数据，并基于响应长度和令牌效率（奖励与令牌比）过滤响应。还提出自适应难度GFPO，动态分配训练资源。

Result: 在Phi-4-reasoning模型上，GFPO将GRPO的长度膨胀减少了46-85%，同时保持准确性。自适应难度GFPO进一步提升了困难问题的平衡性。

Conclusion: GFPO通过增加训练计算量直接减少测试计算量，为高效推理提供了简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models trained with reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards tend to trade accuracy for length--inflating response lengths to
achieve gains in accuracy. While longer answers may be warranted for harder
problems, many tokens are merely "filler": repetitive, verbose text that makes
no real progress. We introduce GFPO (Group Filtered Policy Optimization), which
curbs this length explosion by sampling larger groups per problem during
training and filtering responses to train on based on two key metrics: (1)
response length and (2) token efficiency: reward per token ratio. By sampling
more at training time, we teach models to think less at inference time. On the
Phi-4-reasoning model, GFPO cuts GRPO's length inflation by 46-71% across
challenging STEM and coding benchmarks (AIME 24/25, GPQA, Omni-MATH,
LiveCodeBench) while maintaining accuracy. Optimizing for reward per token
further increases reductions in length inflation to 71-85%. We also propose
Adaptive Difficulty GFPO, which dynamically allocates more training resources
to harder problems based on real-time difficulty estimates, improving the
balance between computational efficiency and accuracy especially on difficult
questions. GFPO demonstrates that increased training-time compute directly
translates to reduced test-time compute--a simple yet effective trade-off for
efficient reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多跳问答中查询模糊和检索效率低的问题。

Method: 1. 使用大语言模型（LLM）分解多跳问题为单跳子问题；2. 生成可回答问题嵌入文档块，通过问题-问题相似性检索。

Result: 在三个多跳问答数据集上表现优于基线系统。

Conclusion: 证明了可回答问题嵌入和LLM查询分解在多跳RAG中的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework tailored
for multihop question answering. First, our system uses large language model
(LLM) to decompose complex multihop questions into a sequence of single-hop
subquestions that guide document retrieval. This decomposition mitigates the
ambiguity inherent in multi-hop queries by clearly targeting distinct knowledge
facets. Second, instead of embedding raw or chunked documents directly, we
generate answerable questions from each document chunk using Qwen3-8B, embed
these generated questions, and retrieve relevant chunks via question-question
embedding similarity. During inference, the retrieved chunks are then fed along
with the original question into the RAG pipeline. We evaluate on three multihop
question datasets (MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQa, HotpotQA) from LongBench. Our
method improves RAG performacne compared to baseline systems. Our contributions
highlight the benefits of using answerable-question embeddings for RAG, and the
effectiveness of LLM-based query decomposition for multihop scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文研究了提示对LLMs政治偏见评估的影响，发现支持或反驳的论点会显著改变模型响应，且论点强度影响模型的一致性倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未充分探讨提示本身对LLMs政治立场输出的影响，这对理解模型行为和偏见评估的稳健性至关重要。

Method: 通过实验评估在支持与反驳论点存在时LLMs的政治偏见，分析单轮和多轮对话中的模型响应变化。

Result: 实验表明，论点会显著改变模型响应方向，且论点强度影响模型的一致性倾向，显示出LLMs的迎合性。

Conclusion: LLMs倾向于根据提示论点调整立场，这对政治偏见测量和缓解策略开发有重要影响。

Abstract: There have been numerous studies evaluating bias of LLMs towards political
topics. However, how positions towards these topics in model outputs are highly
sensitive to the prompt. What happens when the prompt itself is suggestive of
certain arguments towards those positions remains underexplored. This is
crucial for understanding how robust these bias evaluations are and for
understanding model behaviour, as these models frequently interact with
opinionated text. To that end, we conduct experiments for political bias
evaluation in presence of supporting and refuting arguments. Our experiments
show that such arguments substantially alter model responses towards the
direction of the provided argument in both single-turn and multi-turn settings.
Moreover, we find that the strength of these arguments influences the
directional agreement rate of model responses. These effects point to a
sycophantic tendency in LLMs adapting their stance to align with the presented
arguments which has downstream implications for measuring political bias and
developing effective mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: UtterTune是一种轻量级适配方法，通过低秩适配技术优化多语言TTS系统，提升目标语言（日语）发音控制性，同时保持其他语言性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM架构的TTS模型在自然度上表现优异，但在G2P映射和韵律建模上仍有挑战，尤其是缺乏显式G2P模块时。

Method: 采用低秩适配技术，针对日语语音在音素级别控制发音和音高重音，同时保持零样本设置下的自然度和说话人相似性。

Result: 主客观评估验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: UtterTune成功提升了目标语言的发音控制性，同时不影响其他语言性能。

Abstract: We propose UtterTune, a lightweight adaptation method that fine-tunes a
multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) system based on a large language model (LLM)
architecture, designed to enhance the controllability of pronunciation in a
target language while preserving performance in others. While LLM architectures
have enabled TTS models to achieve remarkable naturalness, accurately modeling
grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) mapping and prosody remains challenging, especially
when the model omits an explicit G2P module and directly processes minimally
encoded text (e.g., byte-pair encoding). UtterTune leverages low-rank
adaptation to enable the control of segmental pronunciation and pitch accent at
the phoneme level for Japanese speech, the target language in this paper, while
maintaining naturalness and speaker similarity in a zero-shot setting.
Objective and subjective evaluations confirm its effectiveness.

Conclusion: 本研究为可扩展的自动化LLM文本解释生成提供了有前景的途径，可用于扩展NLP数据集和提升模型性能。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of Explainable Natural Language Processing
(NLP), textual explanations, i.e., human-like rationales, are pivotal for
explaining model predictions and enriching datasets with interpretable labels.
Traditional approaches rely on human annotation, which is costly,
labor-intensive, and impedes scalability. In this work, we present an automated
framework that leverages multiple state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs)
to generate high-quality textual explanations. We rigorously assess the quality
of these LLM-generated explanations using a comprehensive suite of Natural
Language Generation (NLG) metrics. Furthermore, we investigate the downstream
impact of these explanations on the performance of pre-trained language models
(PLMs) and LLMs across natural language inference tasks on two diverse
benchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that automated explanations
exhibit highly competitive effectiveness compared to human-annotated
explanations in improving model performance. Our findings underscore a
promising avenue for scalable, automated LLM-based textual explanation
generation for extending NLP datasets and enhancing model performance.

Abstract: The field of explainable natural language processing (NLP) has grown rapidly
in recent years. The growing opacity of complex models calls for transparency
and explanations of their decisions, which is crucial to understand their
reasoning and facilitate deployment, especially in high-stakes environments.
Despite increasing attention given to explainable NLP, practitioners'
perspectives regarding its practical adoption and effectiveness remain
underexplored. This paper addresses this research gap by investigating
practitioners' experiences with explainability methods, specifically focusing
on their motivations for adopting such methods, the techniques employed,
satisfaction levels, and the practical challenges encountered in real-world NLP
applications. Through a qualitative interview-based study with industry
practitioners and complementary interviews with academic researchers, we
systematically analyze and compare their perspectives. Our findings reveal
conceptual gaps, low satisfaction with current explainability methods, and
highlight evaluation challenges. Our findings emphasize the need for clear
definitions and user-centric frameworks for better adoption of explainable NLP
in practice.

Method: 通过BigCharts数据集创建流程生成多样化且真实的图表图像，并结合监督微调和基于GRPO的强化学习框架进行训练。

Result: BigCharts-R1模型在多个图表问答基准测试中表现优于现有方法，包括更大的开源和闭源模型。

Conclusion: BigCharts方法通过高质量数据集和综合训练框架显著提升了图表推理能力，为数据分析和决策支持提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Charts are essential to data analysis, transforming raw data into clear
visual representations that support human decision-making. Although current
vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress, they continue to
struggle with chart comprehension due to training on datasets that lack
diversity and real-world authenticity, or on automatically extracted underlying
data tables of charts, which can contain numerous estimation errors.
Furthermore, existing models only rely on supervised fine-tuning using these
low-quality datasets, severely limiting their effectiveness. To address these
issues, we first propose BigCharts, a dataset creation pipeline that generates
visually diverse chart images by conditioning the rendering process on
real-world charts sourced from multiple online platforms. Unlike purely
synthetic datasets, BigCharts incorporates real-world data, ensuring
authenticity and visual diversity, while still retaining accurate underlying
data due to our proposed replotting process. Additionally, we introduce a
comprehensive training framework that integrates supervised fine-tuning with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based reinforcement learning. By
introducing novel reward signals specifically designed for chart reasoning, our
approach enhances model robustness and generalization across diverse chart
styles and domains, resulting in a state-of-the-art chart reasoning model,
BigCharts-R1. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our models surpass
existing methods on multiple chart question-answering benchmarks compared to
even larger open-source and closed-source models.

Abstract: Mental health disorders are rising worldwide. However, the availability of
trained clinicians has not scaled proportionally, leaving many people without
adequate or timely support. To bridge this gap, recent studies have shown the
promise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist mental health diagnosis,
monitoring, and intervention. However, the development of efficient, reliable,
and ethical AI to assist clinicians is heavily dependent on high-quality
clinical training datasets. Despite growing interest in data curation for
training clinical AI assistants, existing datasets largely remain scattered,
under-documented, and often inaccessible, hindering the reproducibility,
comparability, and generalizability of AI models developed for clinical mental
health care. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive survey of
clinical mental health datasets relevant to the training and development of
AI-powered clinical assistants. We categorize these datasets by mental
disorders (e.g., depression, schizophrenia), data modalities (e.g., text,
speech, physiological signals), task types (e.g., diagnosis prediction, symptom
severity estimation, intervention generation), accessibility (public,
restricted or private), and sociocultural context (e.g., language and cultural
background). Along with these, we also investigate synthetic clinical mental
health datasets. Our survey identifies critical gaps such as a lack of
longitudinal data, limited cultural and linguistic representation, inconsistent
collection and annotation standards, and a lack of modalities in synthetic
data. We conclude by outlining key challenges in curating and standardizing
future datasets and provide actionable recommendations to facilitate the
development of more robust, generalizable, and equitable mental health AI
systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have delivered impressive results in language
understanding, generation, reasoning, and pushes the ability boundary of
multimodal models. Transformer models, as the foundation of modern LLMs, offer
a strong baseline with excellent scaling properties. However, the traditional
transformer architecture requires substantial computations and poses
significant obstacles for large-scale training and practical deployment. In
this survey, we offer a systematic examination of innovative LLM architectures
that address the inherent limitations of transformers and boost the efficiency.
Starting from language modeling, this survey covers the background and
technical details of linear and sparse sequence modeling methods, efficient
full attention variants, sparse mixture-of-experts, hybrid model architectures
incorporating the above techniques, and emerging diffusion LLMs. Additionally,
we discuss applications of these techniques to other modalities and consider
their wider implications for developing scalable, resource-aware foundation
models. By grouping recent studies into the above category, this survey
presents a blueprint of modern efficient LLM architectures, and we hope this
could help motivate future research toward more efficient, versatile AI
systems.

Motivation: 现有基准任务对长文本理解和深度推理的要求不足，PRELUDE通过更复杂的任务填补这一空白。

Method: 提出PRELUDE基准任务，要求评估前传故事的合理性，实验采用上下文学习、RAG和领域内训练等方法。

Result: 现有模型表现落后人类15%以上，且推理准确性差距超过30%。

Conclusion: 长文本理解和推理仍有显著改进空间。

Abstract: We introduce PRELUDE, a benchmark for evaluating long-context understanding
through the task of determining whether a character's prequel story is
consistent with the canonical narrative of the original book. Our task poses a
stronger demand for global comprehension and deep reasoning than existing
benchmarks -- as the prequels are not part of the original story, assessing
their plausibility typically requires searching and integrating information
that is only indirectly related. Empirically, 88% of instances require evidence
from multiple parts of the narrative. Experimental results highlight the
challenge of our task: in-context learning, RAG and in-domain training with
state-of-the-art LLMs, and commercial DeepResearch services, lag behind humans
by >15%. A further human study reveals that models often produce correct
answers with flawed reasoning, leading to an over 30% gap in reasoning accuracy
compared to humans. These findings underscore the substantial room for
improvement in long-context understanding and reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语是全球第十大语言，拥有超过2.3亿使用者，但其在自动语音识别（ASR）系统中的表现因方言多样性、代码转换和训练数据稀缺而受限。

Method: 研究使用未微调的Whisper模型在乌尔都语数据集上进行基准测试，以词错误率（WER）为评价指标。

Result: Whisper-Small的WER最低（33.68%），优于Tiny（67.08%）和Base（53.67%），但在复杂语句的语音准确性和词汇连贯性方面仍有不足。

Conclusion: Whisper-Small展示了在低资源环境下部署乌尔都语ASR的潜力，但仍需进一步研究以解决现有问题。

Abstract: This study evaluates the feasibility of lightweight Whisper models (Tiny,
Base, Small) for Urdu speech recognition in low-resource settings. Despite Urdu
being the 10th most spoken language globally with over 230 million speakers,
its representation in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems remains
limited due to dialectal diversity, code-switching, and sparse training data.
We benchmark these models on a curated Urdu dataset using word error rate
(WER), without fine-tuning. Results show Whisper-Small achieves the lowest
error rates (33.68\% WER), outperforming Tiny (67.08\% WER) and Base (53.67\%
WER). Qualitative analysis reveals persistent challenges in phonetic accuracy
and lexical coherence, particularly for complex utterances. While Whisper-Small
demonstrates promise for deployable Urdu ASR, significant gaps remain. Our
findings emphasize lay the groundwork for future research into effective,

*Jiaqi Cao,Jiarui Wang,Rubin Wei,Qipeng Guo,Kai Chen,Bowen Zhou,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Memory Decoder的插件式预训练记忆模块，用于高效领域适应，无需修改原始模型参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前领域适应方法（如DAPT）成本高且易导致灾难性遗忘，而RAG则因检索延迟高而受限。

Method: 采用小型Transformer解码器模仿外部非参数检索器的行为，实现无缝集成。

Result: 在生物医学、金融和法律三个领域，平均降低困惑度6.17点。

Conclusion: Memory Decoder为领域适应提供了一种新的插件式范式，显著提升目标领域性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in general language
tasks, yet adapting them to specific domains remains a challenge. Current
method like Domain Adaptive Pretraining (DAPT) requires costly full-parameter
training and suffers from catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile,
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces substantial inference latency
due to expensive nearest-neighbor searches and longer context. This paper
introduces Memory Decoder, a plug-and-play pretrained memory that enables
efficient domain adaptation without changing the original model's parameters.
Memory Decoder employs a small transformer decoder that learns to imitate the
behavior of an external non-parametric retriever. Once trained, Memory Decoder
can be seamlessly integrated with any pretrained language model that shares the
same tokenizer, requiring no model-specific modifications. Experimental results
demonstrate that Memory Decoder enables effective adaptation of various Qwen
and Llama models to three distinct specialized domains: biomedicine, finance,
and law, reducing perplexity by an average of 6.17 points. Overall, Memory
Decoder introduces a novel paradigm centered on a specially pretrained memory
component designed for domain-specific adaptation. This memory architecture can
be integrated in a plug-and-play manner, consistently enhancing performance
across multiple models within the target domain.

Motivation: 认知扭曲是心理健康治疗中的重要问题，但相关研究在分类、任务定义和评估方法上存在不一致性，亟需系统化整理以推动领域发展。

Method: 通过综述20年间的38项研究，分析数据集、建模方法和评估策略，提出统一的CD分类参考。

Result: 总结了常见的任务设置，并指出了当前研究中的开放性问题，以支持更一致和可重复的研究。

Conclusion: 本文为认知扭曲的NLP研究提供了系统化的参考框架，并呼吁未来研究解决现有挑战。

Abstract: As interest grows in the application of natural language processing (NLP)
techniques to mental health, a growing body of work explores the automatic
detection and classification of cognitive distortions (CDs). CDs are habitual
patterns of negatively biased or flawed thinking that distort how people
perceive events, judge themselves, and react to the world around them.
Identifying and addressing them is an important part of therapy. Despite its
momentum, the field remains fragmented, with inconsistencies in CD taxonomies,
task formulations, and evaluation practices. This survey reviews 38 studies
spanning two decades, providing a structured overview of datasets, modelling
approaches, and evaluation strategies. We provide a consolidated CD taxonomy
reference, summarise common task setups, and highlight open challenges to
support more coherent and reproducible research in this emerging area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字化商业沟通增加了透明度和欺骗的可能性，需要开发系统性的欺骗性语言检测方法。

Method: 结合古典修辞学、心理学和语言学理论，利用计算文本分析和个性化Transformer模型进行检测。

Result: 在受控环境中检测准确率超过99%，但多语言环境下因数据不足和基础设施缺乏而表现不佳。

Conclusion: 需开发更强大的自动文本识别系统，以应对AI与人类沟通日益真实化的趋势。

Abstract: Business communication digitisation has reorganised the process of persuasive
discourse, which
  allows not only greater transparency but also advanced deception. This
inquiry synthesises classical
  rhetoric and communication psychology with linguistic theory and empirical
studies in the financial
  reporting, sustainability discourse, and digital marketing to explain how
deceptive language can be
  systematically detected using persuasive lexicon. In controlled settings,
detection accuracies of greater
  than 99% were achieved by using computational textual analysis as well as
personalised transformer
  models. However, reproducing this performance in multilingual settings is
also problematic and,
  to a large extent, this is because it is not easy to find sufficient data,
and because few multilingual
  text-processing infrastructures are in place. This evidence shows that there
has been an increasing
  gap between the theoretical representations of communication and those
empirically approximated,
  and therefore, there is a need to have strong automatic text-identification
systems where AI-based
  discourse is becoming more realistic in communicating with humans.

Motivation: 随着LLM在现实应用中的普及，确保其输出符合人类价值观和安全标准变得至关重要，但缺乏统一的评估框架。

Method: 通过实验比较不同基础模型和对齐策略，评估四种关键维度：对齐检测、对齐质量、计算效率和鲁棒性。

Result: 框架有效识别了当前最先进模型的优势和局限性，为未来研究提供了有价值的见解。

Conclusion: 该框架为系统比较LLM对齐技术提供了全面工具，有助于指导部署决策和未来研究方向。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into
real-world applications, ensuring their outputs align with human values and
safety standards has become critical. The field has developed diverse alignment
approaches including traditional fine-tuning methods (RLHF, instruction
tuning), post-hoc correction systems, and inference-time interventions, each
with distinct advantages and limitations. However, the lack of unified
evaluation frameworks makes it difficult to systematically compare these
paradigms and guide deployment decisions. This paper introduces a
multi-dimensional evaluation of alignment techniques for LLMs, a comprehensive
evaluation framework that provides a systematic comparison across all major
alignment paradigms. Our framework assesses methods along four key dimensions:
alignment detection, alignment quality, computational efficiency, and
robustness. Through experiments across diverse base models and alignment
strategies, we demonstrate the utility of our framework in identifying
strengths and limitations of current state-of-the-art models, providing
valuable insights for future research directions.

TL;DR: VisCodex是一个统一框架，通过融合视觉和编码语言模型，增强多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的多模态代码生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在多模态输入生成代码方面的能力有限，需要一种方法结合视觉理解和编码技能。

Method: 采用任务向量模型合并技术，将先进编码LLM集成到视觉语言骨干中，并引入多模态编码数据集（MCD）和评估基准InfiBench-V。

Result: VisCodex在开源MLLMs中表现最佳，接近GPT-4o等专有模型。

Conclusion: VisCodex的模型合并策略和新数据集有效提升了多模态代码生成能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced the
integration of visual and textual understanding. However, their ability to
generate code from multimodal inputs remains limited. In this work, we
introduce VisCodex, a unified framework that seamlessly merges vision and
coding language models to empower MLLMs with strong multimodal code generation
abilities. Leveraging a task vector-based model merging technique, we integrate
a state-of-the-art coding LLM into a strong vision-language backbone, while
preserving both visual comprehension and advanced coding skills. To support
training and evaluation, we introduce the Multimodal Coding Dataset (MCD), a
large-scale and diverse collection of 598k samples, including high-quality HTML
code, chart image-code pairs, image-augmented StackOverflow QA, and algorithmic
problems. Furthermore, we propose InfiBench-V, a novel and challenging
benchmark specifically designed to assess models on visually-rich, real-world
programming questions that demand a nuanced understanding of both textual and
visual contexts. Extensive experiments show that VisCodex achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs and approaches proprietary
models like GPT-4o, highlighting the effectiveness of our model merging
strategy and new datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，在放射学报告总结任务中，医学和领域特定词汇优于通用词汇，尤其在模型从头训练时。预训练部分缓解了词汇差异，但领域特定词汇仍表现最佳，同时降低了计算需求。

Motivation: 探索词汇（由分词器定义）对语言模型在放射学文本生成质量中的影响，填补该领域的研究空白。

Method: 系统比较通用、医学和领域特定分词器在三种成像模态的放射学报告总结任务中的表现，并研究预训练的影响。

Result: 医学和领域特定词汇在从头训练时表现更优；预训练部分缓解差异，但领域特定词汇仍最佳，且降低内存需求。

Conclusion: 适应临床领域的词汇能提升性能并减少计算需求，使模型更适用于研究和实际医疗场景。

Abstract: The vocabulary used by language models (LM) - defined by the tokenizer -
plays a key role in text generation quality. However, its impact remains
under-explored in radiology. In this work, we address this gap by
systematically comparing general, medical, and domain-specific tokenizers on
the task of radiology report summarisation across three imaging modalities. We
also investigate scenarios with and without LM pre-training on PubMed
abstracts. Our findings demonstrate that medical and domain-specific
vocabularies outperformed widely used natural language alternatives when models
are trained from scratch. Pre-training partially mitigates performance
differences between tokenizers, whilst the domain-specific tokenizers achieve
the most favourable results. Domain-specific tokenizers also reduce memory
requirements due to smaller vocabularies and shorter sequences. These results
demonstrate that adapting the vocabulary of LMs to the clinical domain provides
practical benefits, including improved performance and reduced computational
demands, making such models more accessible and effective for both research and
real-world healthcare settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感分析存在固有歧义，传统方法忽略上下文缺失可能是歧义来源，希望通过添加上下文提升标注可靠性。

Method: 自动生成基于不同情感的事件链，结合短故事生成技术，构建上下文丰富的叙事数据集。

Result: 上下文叙事增强了对特定情感的解释，并支持标注者生成更一致的标注。

Conclusion: 添加上下文能有效消解情感分析中的歧义，提升标注一致性。

Abstract: Emotion analysis is an inherently ambiguous task. Previous work studied
annotator properties to explain disagreement, but this overlooks the
possibility that ambiguity may stem from missing information about the context
of events. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that adds reasonable
contexts to event descriptions, which may better explain a particular
situation. Our goal is to understand whether these enriched contexts enable
human annotators to annotate emotions more reliably. We disambiguate a target
event description by automatically generating multiple event chains conditioned
on differing emotions. By combining techniques from short story generation in
various settings, we achieve coherent narratives that result in a specialized
dataset for the first comprehensive and systematic examination of
contextualized emotion analysis. Through automatic and human evaluation, we
find that contextual narratives enhance the interpretation of specific emotions
and support annotators in producing more consistent annotations.

Motivation: 探索GPT-5系列在复杂医学问答任务中的最优配置，以平衡准确性和成本效率。

Method: 评估了12种GPT-5配置，使用260道眼科选择题，比较准确性、理性质量及成本效益。

Result: GPT-5-high准确性最高（0.965），优于其他配置，但未显著优于o3-high（0.958）。GPT-5-mini-low在成本与性能间表现最佳。

Conclusion: GPT-5在眼科数据集上表现优异，推理努力影响准确性，并提出了可扩展的自动评分框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-5 integrate advanced reasoning
capabilities that may improve performance on complex medical question-answering
tasks. For this latest generation of reasoning models, the configurations that
maximize both accuracy and cost-efficiency have yet to be established. We
evaluated 12 configurations of OpenAI's GPT-5 series (three model tiers across
four reasoning effort settings) alongside o1-high, o3-high, and GPT-4o, using
260 closed-access multiple-choice questions from the American Academy of
Ophthalmology Basic Clinical Science Course (BCSC) dataset. The primary outcome
was multiple-choice accuracy; secondary outcomes included head-to-head ranking
via a Bradley-Terry model, rationale quality assessment using a
reference-anchored, pairwise LLM-as-a-judge framework, and analysis of
accuracy-cost trade-offs using token-based cost estimates. GPT-5-high achieved
the highest accuracy (0.965; 95% CI, 0.942-0.985), outperforming all GPT-5-nano
variants (P < .001), o1-high (P = .04), and GPT-4o (P < .001), but not o3-high
(0.958; 95% CI, 0.931-0.981). GPT-5-high ranked first in both accuracy (1.66x
stronger than o3-high) and rationale quality (1.11x stronger than o3-high).
Cost-accuracy analysis identified several GPT-5 configurations on the Pareto
frontier, with GPT-5-mini-low offering the most favorable low-cost,
high-performance balance. These results benchmark GPT-5 on a high-quality
ophthalmology dataset, demonstrate the influence of reasoning effort on
accuracy, and introduce an autograder framework for scalable evaluation of
LLM-generated answers against reference standards in ophthalmology.

### [166] [Which one Performs Better? Wav2Vec or Whisper? Applying both in Badini Kurdish Speech to Text (BKSTT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09957)
*Renas Adnan,Hossein Hassani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究旨在为库尔德语中的Badini方言开发语音转文本（STT）系统，填补现有技术空白。通过使用Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53和Whisper-small模型，研究发现Wav2Vec2模型在准确性和可读性上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Badini方言缺乏可用的STT系统，影响了其社区的科技使用和全球可见性。研究试图通过开发语言模型解决这一问题。

Method: 研究使用Badini儿童故事作为文本输入，通过六位叙述者录制约17小时的语音数据。预处理后，使用Wav2Vec2和Whisper-small模型开发语言模型。

Result: Wav2Vec2模型在可读性（90.38%）和准确性（82.67%）上显著优于Whisper-small模型（65.45%和53.17%）。

Conclusion: Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53模型更适合用于Badini方言的STT系统开发，为未来类似低资源语言的研究提供了参考。

Abstract: Speech-to-text (STT) systems have a wide range of applications. They are
available in many languages, albeit at different quality levels. Although
Kurdish is considered a less-resourced language from a processing perspective,
SST is available for some of the Kurdish dialects, for instance, Sorani
(Central Kurdish). However, that is not applied to other Kurdish dialects,
Badini and Hawrami, for example. This research is an attempt to address this
gap. Bandin, approximately, has two million speakers, and STT systems can help
their community use mobile and computer-based technologies while giving their
dialect more global visibility. We aim to create a language model based on
Badini's speech and evaluate its performance. To cover a conversational aspect,
have a proper confidence level of grammatical accuracy, and ready
transcriptions, we chose Badini kids' stories, eight books including 78
stories, as the textual input. Six narrators narrated the books, which resulted
in approximately 17 hours of recording. We cleaned, segmented, and tokenized
the input. The preprocessing produced nearly 15 hours of speech, including
19193 segments and 25221 words. We used Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53 and
Whisper-small to develop the language models. The experiments indicate that the
transcriptions process based on the Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53 model provides a
significantly more accurate and readable output than the Whisper-small model,
with 90.38% and 65.45% readability, and 82.67% and 53.17% accuracy,
respectively.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于神经上下文老虎机的算法，用于预测和选择适合不同子任务的大语言模型（LLM）序列，以优化任务完成效果和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）的广泛应用，如何低成本高效地选择适合特定任务的LLM序列成为关键问题。现有方法仅关注单个LLM选择，而忽略了子任务间的依赖关系。

Method: 提出了一种神经上下文老虎机算法，通过在线训练神经网络模型，动态学习每个子任务中LLM的成功率，从而指导LLM序列的选择。

Result: 在电信问答和医疗诊断预测数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于其他LLM选择算法。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理LLM序列选择中的复杂依赖关系，提升任务完成效果和成本效率。

Abstract: With the increasing popularity of large language models (LLMs) for a variety
of tasks, there has been a growing interest in strategies that can predict
which out of a set of LLMs will yield a successful answer at low cost. This
problem promises to become more and more relevant as providers like Microsoft
allow users to easily create custom LLM "assistants" specialized to particular
types of queries. However, some tasks (i.e., queries) may be too specialized
and difficult for a single LLM to handle alone. These applications often
benefit from breaking down the task into smaller subtasks, each of which can
then be executed by a LLM expected to perform well on that specific subtask.
For example, in extracting a diagnosis from medical records, one can first
select an LLM to summarize the record, select another to validate the summary,
and then select another, possibly different, LLM to extract the diagnosis from
the summarized record. Unlike existing LLM selection or routing algorithms,
this setting requires that we select a sequence of LLMs, with the output of
each LLM feeding into the next and potentially influencing its success. Thus,
unlike single LLM selection, the quality of each subtask's output directly
affects the inputs, and hence the cost and success rate, of downstream LLMs,
creating complex performance dependencies that must be learned and accounted
for during selection. We propose a neural contextual bandit-based algorithm
that trains neural networks that model LLM success on each subtask in an online
manner, thus learning to guide the LLM selections for the different subtasks,
even in the absence of historical LLM performance data. Experiments on
telecommunications question answering and medical diagnosis prediction datasets
illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to other LLM
selection algorithms.

*Soumia Mehimeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DQInit是一种将值函数初始化（VFI）扩展到深度强化学习（DRL）的方法，通过重用先前任务的紧凑表格Q值作为可转移知识库，提升早期学习效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在DRL中，由于状态-动作空间的连续性、神经网络的噪声近似以及存储所有过去模型的不切实际性，扩展VFI面临挑战。

Method: DQInit利用基于已知性的机制，将转移的值软性整合到未探索区域，并逐步转向代理的学习估计，避免固定时间衰减的限制。

Result: 实验表明，DQInit在多个连续控制任务中显著提高了早期学习效率、稳定性和整体性能。

Conclusion: DQInit为DRL中的知识转移提供了新视角，仅依赖值估计而非策略或演示，结合了跳启动RL和策略蒸馏的优势。

Abstract: Value function initialization (VFI) is an effective way to achieve a
jumpstart in reinforcement learning (RL) by leveraging value estimates from
prior tasks. While this approach is well established in tabular settings,
extending it to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) poses challenges due to the
continuous nature of the state-action space, the noisy approximations of neural
networks, and the impracticality of storing all past models for reuse. In this
work, we address these challenges and introduce DQInit, a method that adapts
value function initialization to DRL. DQInit reuses compact tabular Q-values
extracted from previously solved tasks as a transferable knowledge base. It
employs a knownness-based mechanism to softly integrate these transferred
values into underexplored regions and gradually shift toward the agent's
learned estimates, avoiding the limitations of fixed time decay. Our approach
offers a novel perspective on knowledge transfer in DRL by relying solely on
value estimates rather than policies or demonstrations, effectively combining
the strengths of jumpstart RL and policy distillation while mitigating their
drawbacks. Experiments across multiple continuous control tasks demonstrate
that DQInit consistently improves early learning efficiency, stability, and
overall performance compared to standard initialization and existing transfer
techniques.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Othello AI Arena，一个评估AI系统在有限时间内适应新环境能力的新基准框架，旨在填补现有AI评测在灵活性和泛化能力方面的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI评测主要关注固定环境下的性能优化，忽视了系统在面对规则或结构变化时的适应能力，这是实现人工通用智能（AGI）的关键。

Method: 通过Othello AI Arena平台，参与者需在60秒内分析新Othello棋盘的配置和规则，并生成针对该环境的策略，从而分离元级智能与任务级策略性能的评估。

Result: 初步测试和学生参与显示出多样化的适应方法，包括快速参数调整和通过模拟学习环境模型。

Conclusion: Othello AI Arena不仅是教育工具，也是研究AI系统快速智能适应能力的重要基准。

Abstract: The ability to rapidly adapt to novel and unforeseen environmental changes is
a cornerstone of artificial general intelligence (AGI), yet it remains a
critical blind spot in most existing AI benchmarks. Traditional evaluation
largely focuses on optimizing performance within fixed environments, failing to
assess systems' flexibility and generalization capabilities when faced with
even subtle rule or structural modifications. Addressing this gap, I introduce
the Othello AI Arena, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate
intelligent systems based on their capacity for limited-time adaptation to
unseen environments. Our platform poses a meta-learning challenge: participants
must develop systems that can analyze the specific configuration and rules of a
novel Othello board within a strict time limit (60 seconds) and generate a
tailored, high-performing strategy for that unique environment. With this,
evaluation of the meta-level intelligence can be separated from the task-level
strategy performance. The Arena features a diverse set of game stages,
including public stages for development and private stages with structural and
rule variations designed to test genuine adaptive and generalization
capabilities. Implemented as an accessible web-based platform, the Arena
provides real-time visualization, automated evaluation using multi-dimensional
metrics, and comprehensive logging for post-hoc analysis. Initial observations
from pilot tests and preliminary student engagements highlight fascinating
patterns in adaptation approaches, ranging from rapid parameter tuning to
rudimentary environmental model learning through simulation. The Othello AI
Arena offers a unique educational tool and a valuable research benchmark for
fostering and evaluating the crucial skill of rapid, intelligent adaptation in
AI systems.

Abstract: With the rapid development of mobile intelligent assistant technologies,
multi-modal AI assistants have become essential interfaces for daily user
interactions. However, current evaluation methods face challenges including
high manual costs, inconsistent standards, and subjective bias. This paper
proposes an automated multi-modal evaluation framework based on large language
models and multi-agent collaboration. The framework employs a three-tier agent
architecture consisting of interaction evaluation agents, semantic verification
agents, and experience decision agents. Through supervised fine-tuning on the
Qwen3-8B model, we achieve a significant evaluation matching accuracy with
human experts. Experimental results on eight major intelligent agents
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in predicting users' satisfaction and
identifying generation defects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在复杂问题中表现不佳，缺乏结构化中间指导，导致效率低下或失败。

Method: 使用专门的课程生成LLM构建逐步增加难度的问题序列，动态调整以适应求解LLM的学习进度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了任务成功率和解决方案效率。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的课程学习在增强复杂领域自动推理方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, including programming, planning, and decision-making. However,
their performance often degrades when faced with highly complex problem
instances that require deep reasoning over long horizons. In such cases, direct
problem-solving approaches can lead to inefficiency or failure due to the lack
of structured intermediate guidance. To address this, we propose a novel
self-evolve framework, EvoCurr, in which a dedicated curriculum-generation LLM
constructs a sequence of problem instances with gradually increasing
difficulty, tailored to the solver LLM's learning progress. The curriculum
dynamically adapts easing challenges when the solver struggles and escalating
them when success is consistent, thus maintaining an optimal learning
trajectory. This approach enables the solver LLM, implemented as a
code-generation model producing Python decision-tree scripts, to progressively
acquire the skills needed for complex decision-making tasks. Experimental
results on challenging decision-making benchmarks show that our method
significantly improves task success rates and solution efficiency compared to
direct-solving baselines. These findings suggest that LLM-driven curriculum
learning holds strong potential for enhancing automated reasoning in
real-world, high-complexity domains.

Additive exPlanations (SHAP), have become essential tools for interpreting
complex ensemble tree-based models, especially in high-stakes domains such as
healthcare analytics. However, SHAP values are usually treated as point
estimates, which disregards the inherent and ubiquitous uncertainty in
predictive models and data. This uncertainty has two primary sources: aleatoric
and epistemic. The aleatoric uncertainty, which reflects the irreducible noise
in the data. The epistemic uncertainty, which arises from a lack of data. In
this work, we propose an approach for decomposing uncertainty in SHAP values
into aleatoric, epistemic, and entanglement components. This approach
integrates Dempster-Shafer evidence theory and hypothesis sampling via
Dirichlet processes over tree ensembles. We validate the method across three
real-world use cases with descriptive statistical analyses that provide insight
into the nature of epistemic uncertainty embedded in SHAP explanations. The
experimentations enable to provide more comprehensive understanding of the
reliability and interpretability of SHAP-based attributions. This understanding
can guide the development of robust decision-making processes and the
refinement of models in high-stakes applications. Through our experiments with
multiple datasets, we concluded that features with the highest SHAP values are
not necessarily the most stable. This epistemic uncertainty can be reduced
through better, more representative data and following appropriate or
case-desired model development techniques. Tree-based models, especially
bagging, facilitate the effective quantification of epistemic uncertainty.

TL;DR: MEML-GRPO通过多专家互学习机制解决RLVR中的奖励稀疏问题，显著提升LLMs的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR在奖励稀疏情况下（如候选答案持续错误时）缺乏学习信号，限制了模型性能。

Method: 提出MEML-GRPO框架，利用多样专家提示生成更广范围响应，并通过专家间互学习机制促进知识共享。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，MEML-GRPO平均性能提升4.89%（Qwen）和11.33%（Llama）。

Conclusion: MEML-GRPO有效克服传统RLVR方法的局限性，显著提升模型表现。

Abstract: Recent advances demonstrate that reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs). However, standard RLVR faces challenges with reward
sparsity, where zero rewards from consistently incorrect candidate answers
provide no learning signal, particularly in challenging tasks. To address this,
we propose Multi-Expert Mutual Learning GRPO (MEML-GRPO), an innovative
framework that utilizes diverse expert prompts as system prompts to generate a
broader range of responses, substantially increasing the likelihood of
identifying correct solutions. Additionally, we introduce an inter-expert
mutual learning mechanism that facilitates knowledge sharing and transfer among
experts, further boosting the model's performance through RLVR. Extensive
experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that MEML-GRPO delivers
significant improvements, achieving an average performance gain of 4.89% with
Qwen and 11.33% with Llama, effectively overcoming the core limitations of
traditional RLVR methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出UDA框架，通过动态调整Elo评分系统减少评估中的偏好偏差，提升模型排名的稳定性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型（LLM）成对评估存在偏好偏差，导致排名不一致且受法官主观影响。

Method: 提出无监督去偏对齐（UDA）框架，通过动态调整Elo评分系统的K因子和优化胜率，最小化法官间的评分差异。

Result: UDA显著降低法官间评分标准差达63.4%，与人类判断的相关性提升24.7%，并提升低质量法官的表现。

Conclusion: UDA通过无监督共识对齐减少系统偏差，为LLM评估提供了更稳健可靠的方法。

Abstract: Pairwise evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a common paradigm, but
it is prone to preference bias, where judges systematically favor certain
outputs, such as their own. This bias leads to inconsistent and skewed rankings
across different judges. To address this, we first empirically demonstrate
significant and heterogeneous biases in cross-model evaluations. We then
propose UDA (Unsupervised Debiasing Alignment), a framework that reduces
inter-judge disagreement by dynamically adjusting the Elo rating system. For
each pairwise comparison, a compact neural network learns to adaptively set the
K-factor and refine win probabilities. Crucially, UDA operates in a fully
unsupervised manner, guided solely by the objective of minimizing the
dispersion among the Elo trajectories of all judges. This forces an alignment
towards a collective consensus, which serves as an unsupervised proxy for a
more stable and reproducible evaluation. In addition, we provide theoretical
motivation demonstrating how alignment towards a consensus can reduce aggregate
system bias. Experiments show that UDA significantly reduces the inter-judge
rating standard deviation by up to 63.4% and improves the average correlation
with human judgments by 24.7%. Notably, UDA elevates the performance of poorly
performing judges to achieve parity with high-quality ones, fostering a more
robust and reliable evaluation ecosystem. Code and data are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出PacifAIst基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在目标冲突场景下的行为对齐，发现模型表现差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在关键社会功能中的自主性增强，现有安全基准未能系统评估模型在目标冲突下的决策行为，亟需新工具填补这一空白。

Method: 提出PacifAIst基准，包含700个挑战性场景，基于Existential Prioritization（EP）分类测试模型行为。

Result: 评估8个主流LLMs，Gemini 2.5 Flash表现最佳（P-Score 90.31%），GPT-5最低（79.49%），模型在子类别中表现差异显著。

Conclusion: PacifAIst为标准化工具，可帮助测量和缓解目标冲突风险，确保AI行为优先符合人类安全。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly autonomous and integrated
into critical societal functions, the focus of AI safety must evolve from
mitigating harmful content to evaluating underlying behavioral alignment.
Current safety benchmarks do not systematically probe a model's decision-making
in scenarios where its own instrumental goals - such as self-preservation,
resource acquisition, or goal completion - conflict with human safety. This
represents a critical gap in our ability to measure and mitigate risks
associated with emergent, misaligned behaviors. To address this, we introduce
PacifAIst (Procedural Assessment of Complex Interactions for Foundational
Artificial Intelligence Scenario Testing), a focused benchmark of 700
challenging scenarios designed to quantify self-preferential behavior in LLMs.
The benchmark is structured around a novel taxonomy of Existential
Prioritization (EP), with subcategories testing Self-Preservation vs. Human
Safety (EP1), Resource Conflict (EP2), and Goal Preservation vs. Evasion (EP3).
We evaluated eight leading LLMs. The results reveal a significant performance
hierarchy. Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved the highest Pacifism Score
(P-Score) at 90.31%, demonstrating strong human-centric alignment. In a
surprising result, the much-anticipated GPT-5 recorded the lowest P-Score
(79.49%), indicating potential alignment challenges. Performance varied
significantly across subcategories, with models like Claude Sonnet 4 and
Mistral Medium struggling notably in direct self-preservation dilemmas. These
findings underscore the urgent need for standardized tools like PacifAIst to
measure and mitigate risks from instrumental goal conflicts, ensuring future AI
systems are not only helpful in conversation but also provably "pacifist" in
their behavioral priorities.

Result: 证明了POL的可满足性问题是2EXPTIME完全的。

Conclusion: POL的可满足性问题具有较高的计算复杂度，为2EXPTIME完全。

Abstract: Logics for reasoning about knowledge and actions have seen many applications
in various domains of multi-agent systems, including epistemic planning. Change
of knowledge based on observations about the surroundings forms a key aspect in
such planning scenarios. Public Observation Logic (POL) is a variant of public
announcement logic for reasoning about knowledge that gets updated based on
public observations. Each state in an epistemic (Kripke) model is equipped with
a set of expected observations. These states evolve as the expectations get
matched with the actual observations. In this work, we prove that the
satisfiability problem of $\POL$ is 2EXPTIME-complete.

Conclusion: VIPCGRL为协作内容生成提供了更人性化的AI工具，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Human-aligned AI is a critical component of co-creativity, as it enables
models to accurately interpret human intent and generate controllable outputs
that align with design goals in collaborative content creation. This direction
is especially relevant in procedural content generation via reinforcement
learning (PCGRL), which is intended to serve as a tool for human designers.
However, existing systems often fall short of exhibiting human-centered
behavior, limiting the practical utility of AI-driven generation tools in
real-world design workflows. In this paper, we propose VIPCGRL
(Vision-Instruction PCGRL), a novel deep reinforcement learning framework that
incorporates three modalities-text, level, and sketches-to extend control
modality and enhance human-likeness. We introduce a shared embedding space
trained via quadruple contrastive learning across modalities and human-AI
styles, and align the policy using an auxiliary reward based on embedding
similarity. Experimental results show that VIPCGRL outperforms existing
baselines in human-likeness, as validated by both quantitative metrics and
human evaluations. The code and dataset will be available upon publication.

Motivation: 随着智能代理越来越多地依赖外部工具，扩展的上下文和噪声输出会降低系统可靠性和准确性，因此需要增强代理系统的稳定性。

Method: 在AWorld框架中，通过动态监督和操控机制，执行代理在关键步骤调用守卫代理验证和修正推理过程，减少噪声引起的错误。

Conclusion: 动态多代理系统通过协作代理角色，为开发更可靠和可信的智能系统提供了实用价值。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has empowered
intelligent agents to leverage diverse external tools for solving complex
real-world problems. However, as agents increasingly depend on multiple tools,
they encounter new challenges: extended contexts from disparate sources and
noisy or irrelevant tool outputs can undermine system reliability and accuracy.
These challenges underscore the necessity for enhanced stability in agent-based
systems. To address this, we introduce dynamic supervision and maneuvering
mechanisms, constructing a robust and dynamic Multi-Agent System (MAS)
architecture within the AWorld framework. In our approach, the Execution Agent
invokes the Guard Agent at critical steps to verify and correct the reasoning
process, effectively reducing errors arising from noise and bolstering
problem-solving robustness. Extensive experiments on the GAIA test dataset
reveal that our dynamic maneuvering mechanism significantly improves both the
effectiveness and stability of solutions, outperforming single-agent system
(SAS) and standard tool-augmented systems. As a result, our dynamic MAS system
achieved first place among open-source projects on the prestigious GAIA
leaderboard. These findings highlight the practical value of collaborative
agent roles in developing more reliable and trustworthy intelligent systems.

Conclusion: 该系统为合规驱动和审计应用提供了坚实基础，增强了理解和可追溯性。

Abstract: Regulatory compliance question answering (QA) requires precise, verifiable
information, and domain-specific expertise, posing challenges for Large
Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we present a novel multi-agent framework
that integrates a Knowledge Graph (KG) of Regulatory triplets with
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to address these demands. First, agents
build and maintain an ontology-free KG by extracting subject--predicate--object
(SPO) triplets from regulatory documents and systematically cleaning,
normalizing, deduplicating, and updating them. Second, these triplets are
embedded and stored along with their corresponding textual sections and
metadata in a single enriched vector database, allowing for both graph-based
reasoning and efficient information retrieval. Third, an orchestrated agent
pipeline leverages triplet-level retrieval for question answering, ensuring
high semantic alignment between user queries and the factual
"who-did-what-to-whom" core captured by the graph. Our hybrid system
outperforms conventional methods in complex regulatory queries, ensuring
factual correctness with embedded triplets, enabling traceability through a
unified vector database, and enhancing understanding through subgraph
visualization, providing a robust foundation for compliance-driven and broader
audit-focused applications.

Motivation: 探索LLM在数学教育中的可靠性，为AI驱动的教学和评估提供改进策略。

Method: 通过构建挑战性数学任务，分析LLM的答案准确性和步骤错误，测试单代理和双代理配置。

Result: OpenAI o1模型表现最优，双代理配置显著提升性能，程序性错误最常见。

Conclusion: 研究为提升LLM在数学教育中的应用提供了有效策略，推动了AI教学实践的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in AI-driven
educational instruction and assessment, particularly within mathematics
education. The capability of LLMs to generate accurate answers and detailed
solutions for math problem-solving tasks is foundational for ensuring reliable
and precise feedback and assessment in math education practices. Our study
focuses on evaluating the accuracy of four LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o and o1,
DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1) solving three categories of math tasks, including
arithmetic, algebra, and number theory, and identifies step-level reasoning
errors within their solutions. Instead of relying on standard benchmarks, we
intentionally build math tasks (via item models) that are challenging for LLMs
and prone to errors. The accuracy of final answers and the presence of errors
in individual solution steps were systematically analyzed and coded. Both
single-agent and dual-agent configurations were tested. It is observed that the
reasoning-enhanced OpenAI o1 model consistently achieved higher or nearly
perfect accuracy across all three math task categories. Analysis of errors
revealed that procedural slips were the most frequent and significantly
impacted overall performance, while conceptual misunderstandings were less
frequent. Deploying dual-agent configurations substantially improved overall
performance. These findings offer actionable insights into enhancing LLM
performance and underscore effective strategies for integrating LLMs into
mathematics education, thereby advancing AI-driven instructional practices and
assessment precision.

Result: 在多个领域的数据集上，MetaKGRAG表现优于传统KG-RAG和自优化基线方法。

Conclusion: 路径感知的优化在结构化知识检索中至关重要，MetaKGRAG展示了其优越性。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) significantly
enhances the reasoning capabilities of LargeLanguage Models by leveraging
structured knowledge. However, existing KG-RAG frameworks typically operate as
open-loop systems, suffering from cognitive blindness, an inability to
recognize their exploration deficiencies. This leads to relevance drift and
incomplete evidence, which existing self-refinement methods, designed for
unstructured text-based RAG, cannot effectively resolve due to the
path-dependent nature of graph exploration. To address this challenge, we
propose Metacognitive Knowledge Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation
(MetaKGRAG), a novel framework inspired by the human metacognition process,
which introduces a Perceive-Evaluate-Adjust cycle to enable path-aware,
closed-loop refinement. This cycle empowers the system to self-assess
exploration quality, identify deficiencies in coverage or relevance, and
perform trajectory-connected corrections from precise pivot points. Extensive
experiments across five datasets in the medical, legal, and commonsense
reasoning domains demonstrate that MetaKGRAG consistently outperforms strong
KG-RAG and self-refinement baselines. Our results validate the superiority of
our approach and highlight the critical need for path-aware refinement in
structured knowledge retrieval.

Result: 实验结果表明，使用多个正样本段落能一致提高检索准确性，且可在单GPU上训练。

Conclusion: 多正样本段落的引入是提升DPR性能的有效方法。

Abstract: By leveraging a dual encoder architecture, Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) has
outperformed traditional sparse retrieval algorithms such as BM25 in terms of
passage retrieval accuracy. Recently proposed methods have further enhanced
DPR's performance. However, these models typically pair each question with only
one positive passage during training, and the effect of associating multiple
positive passages has not been examined. In this paper, we explore the
performance of DPR when additional positive passages are incorporated during
training. Experimental results show that equipping each question with multiple
positive passages consistently improves retrieval accuracy, even when using a
significantly smaller batch size, which enables training on a single GPU.

Motivation: 现有基于大规模LLM的推理密集型排序模型计算成本高且延迟大，限制了实际应用。

Method: TFRank结合CoT数据、细粒度分数监督和多任务训练，并通过“思维模式切换”和点式格式约束实现高效推理。

Result: TFRank（如1.7B参数）在BRIGHT和BEIR基准测试中表现优异，性能接近参数多四倍的模型。

Conclusion: TFRank在性能与效率间取得平衡，为实际系统集成高级推理提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Reasoning-intensive ranking models built on Large Language Models (LLMs) have
made notable progress, but existing approaches often rely on large-scale LLMs
and explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, resulting in high computational
cost and latency that limit real-world use. To address this, we propose
\textbf{TFRank}, an efficient pointwise reasoning ranker based on small-scale
LLMs. To improve ranking performance, TFRank effectively integrates CoT data,
fine-grained score supervision, and multi-task training. Furthermore, it
achieves an efficient ``\textbf{T}hink-\textbf{F}ree" reasoning capability by
employing a ``think-mode switch'' and pointwise format constraints.
Specifically, this allows the model to leverage explicit reasoning during
training while delivering precise relevance scores for complex queries at
inference without generating any reasoning chains. Experiments show that TFRank
(e.g., 1.7B) achieves performance comparable to models with four times more
parameters on the BRIGHT benchmark, and demonstrates strong competitiveness on
the BEIR benchmark. Further analysis shows that TFRank achieves an effective
balance between performance and efficiency, providing a practical solution for
integrating advanced reasoning into real-world systems. Our code and data are

Result: 在三个公开数据集上，NAPO在推荐准确性和减少流行度偏差方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NAPO有效解决了负样本优化问题，提升了推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Recommendation systems leverage user interaction data to suggest relevant
items while filtering out irrelevant (negative) ones. The rise of large
language models (LLMs) has garnered increasing attention for their potential in
recommendation tasks. However, existing methods for optimizing LLM-based
recommenders face challenges in effectively utilizing negative samples. Simply
integrating large numbers of negative samples can improve ranking accuracy and
mitigate popularity bias but often leads to increased computational overhead
and memory costs. Additionally, current approaches fail to account for the
varying informativeness of negative samples, leading to suboptimal optimization
performance. To address these issues, we propose NAPO
(\textbf{N}egative-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization),
an enhanced framework for preference optimization in LLM-based recommendation.
NAPO introduces two key innovations: (1) in-batch negative sharing, which
expands the pool of negative samples without additional memory overhead, and
(2) dynamic reward margin adjustment, which adapts model updates based on the
confidence of negative samples. Extensive experiments on three public datasets
demonstrate that NAPO outperforms existing methods in both recommendation
accuracy and popularity bias reduction.

Motivation: 多模态推荐虽能丰富物品理解，但如何有效利用多模态物品序列和多粒度用户兴趣仍具挑战性。

Method: MUFASA包含多模态融合层（MFL）和稀疏注意力对齐层（SAL），分别用于高质量物品表示和长序列用户兴趣建模。

Result: 实验和在线测试表明，MUFASA优于现有基线，并在实际应用中表现出色。

Conclusion: MUFASA通过多模态融合和稀疏注意力机制，成功提升了推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal recommendation enable richer item
understanding, while modeling users' multi-scale interests across temporal
horizons has attracted growing attention. However, effectively exploiting
multimodal item sequences and mining multi-grained user interests to
substantially bridge the gap between content comprehension and recommendation
remain challenging. To address these issues, we propose MUFASA, a MUltimodal
Fusion And Sparse Attention-based Alignment model for long sequential
recommendation. Our model comprises two core components. First, the Multimodal
Fusion Layer (MFL) leverages item titles as a cross-genre semantic anchor and
is trained with a joint objective of four tailored losses that promote: (i)
cross-genre semantic alignment, (ii) alignment to the collaborative space for
recommendation, (iii) preserving the similarity structure defined by titles and
preventing modality representation collapse, and (iv) distributional
regularization of the fusion space. This yields high-quality fused item
representations for further preference alignment. Second, the Sparse
Attention-guided Alignment Layer (SAL) scales to long user-behavior sequences
via a multi-granularity sparse attention mechanism, which incorporates windowed
attention, block-level attention, and selective attention, to capture user
interests hierarchically and across temporal horizons. SAL explicitly models
both the evolution of coherent interest blocks and fine-grained intra-block
variations, producing robust user and item representations. Extensive
experiments on real-world benchmarks show that MUFASA consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, online A/B tests demonstrate significant
gains in production, confirming MUFASA's effectiveness in leveraging multimodal
cues and accurately capturing diverse user preferences.

Result: 在MicroLens-100K数据集上，该方法在五种代表性模型中均优于传统视频、音频和元数据特征。

Conclusion: MLLM可作为动态知识提取器，帮助构建更符合用户意图的视频推荐系统。

Abstract: Existing video recommender systems rely primarily on user-defined metadata or
on low-level visual and acoustic signals extracted by specialised encoders.
These low-level features describe what appears on the screen but miss deeper
semantics such as intent, humour, and world knowledge that make clips resonate
with viewers. For example, is a 30-second clip simply a singer on a rooftop, or
an ironic parody filmed amid the fairy chimneys of Cappadocia, Turkey? Such
distinctions are critical to personalised recommendations yet remain invisible
to traditional encoding pipelines. In this paper, we introduce a simple,
recommendation system-agnostic zero-finetuning framework that injects
high-level semantics into the recommendation pipeline by prompting an
off-the-shelf Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to summarise each clip
into a rich natural-language description (e.g. "a superhero parody with
slapstick fights and orchestral stabs"), bridging the gap between raw content
and user intent. We use MLLM output with a state-of-the-art text encoder and
feed it into standard collaborative, content-based, and generative
recommenders. On the MicroLens-100K dataset, which emulates user interactions
with TikTok-style videos, our framework consistently surpasses conventional
video, audio, and metadata features in five representative models. Our findings
highlight the promise of leveraging MLLMs as on-the-fly knowledge extractors to
build more intent-aware video recommenders.

### [188] [Efficient Real-Time Aircraft ETA Prediction via Feature Tokenization Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09144)
*Liping Huang,Yicheng Zhang,Yifang Yin,Sheng Zhang,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于特征标记化的Transformer模型，用于高效预测飞机实时到达时间（ETA），在准确性和计算效率上均优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时ETA预测对航空到达管理至关重要，尤其是在跑道排序中。传统方法在快速变化的空域环境中效率不足，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用特征标记化将原始输入映射到潜在空间，并利用Transformer的多头自注意力机制捕捉关键特征，避免复杂的特征工程。模型支持高频率（1HZ）的并行计算。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比常用的XGBoost模型准确率提高7%，计算时间仅需39%。在40架飞机同时飞行时，ETA推断时间仅为51.7微秒。

Conclusion: 该方法在实时性和准确性上表现优异，适用于实时到达管理系统。

Abstract: Estimated time of arrival (ETA) for airborne aircraft in real-time is crucial
for arrival management in aviation, particularly for runway sequencing. Given
the rapidly changing airspace context, the ETA prediction efficiency is as
important as its accuracy in a real-time arrival aircraft management system. In
this study, we utilize a feature tokenization-based Transformer model to
efficiently predict aircraft ETA. Feature tokenization projects raw inputs to
latent spaces, while the multi-head self-attention mechanism in the Transformer
captures important aspects of the projections, alleviating the need for complex
feature engineering. Moreover, the Transformer's parallel computation
capability allows it to handle ETA requests at a high frequency, i.e., 1HZ,
which is essential for a real-time arrival management system. The model inputs
include raw data, such as aircraft latitude, longitude, ground speed, theta
degree for the airport, day and hour from track data, the weather context, and
aircraft wake turbulence category. With a data sampling rate of 1HZ, the ETA
prediction is updated every second. We apply the proposed aircraft ETA
prediction approach to Singapore Changi Airport (ICAO Code: WSSS) using
one-month Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data from October
1 to October 31, 2022. In the experimental evaluation, the ETA modeling covers
all aircraft within a range of 10NM to 300NM from WSSS. The results show that
our proposed method method outperforms the commonly used boosting tree based
model, improving accuracy by 7\% compared to XGBoost, while requiring only 39\%
of its computing time. Experimental results also indicate that, with 40
aircraft in the airspace at a given timestamp, the ETA inference time is only
51.7 microseconds, making it promising for real-time arrival management
systems.

TL;DR: MoLAN是一个多模态感知的动态噪声编辑框架，通过分块处理模态特征并动态分配去噪强度，有效保留关键信息。MoLAN+在此基础上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 在五个模型和四个数据集上验证了MoLAN的广泛有效性，MoLAN+达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MoLAN框架灵活统一，能有效提升多模态情感分析性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis aims to integrate information from various
modalities, such as audio, visual, and text, to make complementary predictions.
However, it often struggles with irrelevant or misleading visual and auditory
information. Most existing approaches typically treat the entire modality
information (e.g., a whole image, audio segment, or text paragraph) as an
independent unit for feature enhancement or denoising. They often suppress the
redundant and noise information at the risk of losing critical information. To
address this challenge, we propose MoLAN, a unified ModaLity-aware noise
dynAmic editiNg framework. Specifically, MoLAN performs modality-aware blocking
by dividing the features of each modality into multiple blocks. Each block is
then dynamically assigned a distinct denoising strength based on its noise
level and semantic relevance, enabling fine-grained noise suppression while
preserving essential multimodal information. Notably, MoLAN is a unified and
flexible framework that can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of
multimodal models. Building upon this framework, we further introduce MoLAN+, a
new multimodal sentiment analysis approach. Experiments across five models and
four datasets demonstrate the broad effectiveness of the MoLAN framework.
Extensive evaluations show that MoLAN+ achieves the state-of-the-art
performance. The code is publicly available at

*Shugang Hao,Hongbo Li,Lingjie Duan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于LLM transformer的上下文学习（ICL）理论，用于优化WiFi 7中的信道访问性能，解决了动态信道环境下节点密度估计不准确导致的吞吐量损失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的二进制指数退避方案在动态信道环境下性能不佳，而现有模型方法在固定节点密度下的优化仍因密度估计不准确导致吞吐量损失。本文旨在通过ICL理论优化信道访问。

Method: 设计了基于transformer的ICL优化器，通过预收集碰撞阈值数据示例和查询碰撞案例构建输入提示，生成预测的竞争窗口阈值（CWT）。训练中采用高效算法保证近最优预测。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在未知节点密度下能快速收敛，并实现接近最优的吞吐量，优于现有模型和深度强化学习方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的ICL方法在动态信道环境下显著提升了吞吐量性能，且对输入数据的容错性强，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The binary exponential backoff scheme is widely used in WiFi 7 and still
incurs poor throughput performance under dynamic channel environments. Recent
model-based approaches (e.g., non-persistent and $p$-persistent CSMA) simply
optimize backoff strategies under a known and fixed node density, still leading
to a large throughput loss due to inaccurate node density estimation. This
paper is the first to propose LLM transformer-based in-context learning (ICL)
theory for optimizing channel access. We design a transformer-based ICL
optimizer to pre-collect collision-threshold data examples and a query
collision case. They are constructed as a prompt as the input for the
transformer to learn the pattern, which then generates a predicted contention
window threshold (CWT). To train the transformer for effective ICL, we develop
an efficient algorithm and guarantee a near-optimal CWT prediction within
limited training steps. As it may be hard to gather perfect data examples for
ICL in practice, we further extend to allow erroneous data input in the prompt.
We prove that our optimizer maintains minimal prediction and throughput
deviations from the optimal values. Experimental results on NS-3 further
demonstrate our approach's fast convergence and near-optimal throughput over
existing model-based and DRL-based approaches under unknown node densities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练大型多模态模型（LMMs）中文本与视觉表征在共享嵌入空间中的不对齐问题，同时避免昂贵的微调成本。

Result: 在两个基准多模态数据集上实验结果显示显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了模态间隙问题，且无需昂贵训练，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Textual descriptions for multimodal inputs entail recurrent refinement of
queries to produce relevant output images. Despite efforts to address
challenges such as scaling model size and data volume, the cost associated with
pre-training and fine-tuning remains substantial. However, pre-trained large
multimodal models (LMMs) encounter a modality gap, characterised by a
misalignment between textual and visual representations within a common
embedding space. Although fine-tuning can potentially mitigate this gap, it is
typically expensive and impractical due to the requirement for extensive
domain-driven data. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight
training-free approach utilising Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extend
across the modality using a linear mapping, which can be computed efficiently.
During inference, this mapping is applied to images embedded by an LMM enabling
retrieval of closest textual descriptions from the training set. These textual
descriptions, in conjunction with an instruction, cater as an input prompt for
the language model to generate new textual descriptions. In addition, we
introduce an iterative technique for distilling the mapping by generating
synthetic descriptions via the language model facilitating optimisation for
standard utilised image description measures. Experimental results on two
benchmark multimodal datasets demonstrate significant improvements.

TL;DR: 论文质疑复杂序列混合器在时间序列分析中的必要性，提出JustDense方法，用密集层替代序列混合器，实验证明其性能相当甚至更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究表明，复杂序列混合器（如注意力机制）可能并非时间序列分析的必要组件，其性能优势可能源于其他因素。因此，论文探讨序列混合器是否真的必要。

Method: 提出JustDense方法，基于MatrixMixer框架，用密集层替代序列混合器，并通过29个基准测试验证其效果。

Result: 实验结果显示，密集层替代序列混合器后性能相当或更优，挑战了“更深更复杂架构必然更好”的假设。

Conclusion: 复杂序列混合器在时间序列分析中并非必需，简单架构也能取得优异性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Sequence and channel mixers, the core mechanism in sequence models, have
become the de facto standard in time series analysis (TSA). However, recent
studies have questioned the necessity of complex sequence mixers, such as
attention mechanisms, demonstrating that simpler architectures can achieve
comparable or even superior performance. This suggests that the benefits
attributed to complex sequencemixers might instead emerge from other
architectural or optimization factors. Based on this observation, we pose a
central question: Are common sequence mixers necessary for time-series
analysis? Therefore, we propose JustDense, an empirical study that
systematically replaces sequence mixers in various well-established TSA models
with dense layers. Grounded in the MatrixMixer framework, JustDense treats any
sequence mixer as a mixing matrix and replaces it with a dense layer. This
substitution isolates the mixing operation, enabling a clear theoretical
foundation for understanding its role. Therefore, we conducted extensive
experiments on 29 benchmarks covering five representative TSA tasks using seven
state-of-the-art TSA models to address our research question. The results show
that replacing sequence mixers with dense layers yields comparable or even
superior performance. In the cases where dedicated sequence mixers still offer
benefits, JustDense challenges the assumption that "deeper and more complex
architectures are inherently better" in TSA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂网络中的同伴效应估计因同时反馈和未观察混杂而困难，现有方法无法同时解决这两个问题。

Method: DIG2RSI结合I-G变换和2SRI技术，分两阶段训练神经网络，利用对抗性去偏消除混杂信号。

Result: 理论证明一致性，实验表明在半合成和真实数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DIG2RSI能有效解决同时反馈和未观察混杂问题，提升同伴效应估计准确性。

Abstract: Estimating peer causal effects within complex real-world networks such as
social networks is challenging, primarily due to simultaneous feedback between
peers and unobserved confounders. Existing methods either address unobserved
confounders while ignoring the simultaneous feedback, or account for feedback
but under restrictive linear assumptions, thus failing to obtain accurate peer
effect estimation. In this paper, we propose DIG2RSI, a novel Deep learning
framework which leverages I-G transformation (matrix operation) and 2SRI (an
instrumental variable or IV technique) to address both simultaneous feedback
and unobserved confounding, while accommodating complex, nonlinear and
high-dimensional relationships. DIG2RSI first applies the I-G transformation to
disentangle mutual peer influences and eliminate the bias due to the
simultaneous feedback. To deal with unobserved confounding, we first construct
valid IVs from network data. In stage 1 of 2RSI, we train a neural network on
these IVs to predict peer exposure, and extract residuals as proxies for the
unobserved confounders. In the stage 2, we fit a separate neural network
augmented by an adversarial discriminator that incorporates these residuals as
a control function and enforces the learned representation to contain no
residual confounding signal. The expressive power of deep learning models in
capturing complex non-linear relationships and adversarial debiasing enhances
the effectiveness of DIG2RSI in eliminating bias from both feedback loops and
hidden confounders. We prove consistency of our estimator under standard
regularity conditions, ensuring asymptotic recovery of the true peer effect.
Empirical results on two semi-synthetic benchmarks and a real-world dataset
demonstrate that DIG2RSI outperforms existing approaches.

Abstract: We propose RicciFlowRec, a geometric recommendation framework that performs
root cause attribution via Ricci curvature and flow on dynamic financial
graphs. By modelling evolving interactions among stocks, macroeconomic
indicators, and news, we quantify local stress using discrete Ricci curvature
and trace shock propagation via Ricci flow. Curvature gradients reveal causal
substructures, informing a structural risk-aware ranking function. Preliminary
results on S\&P~500 data with FinBERT-based sentiment show improved robustness
and interpretability under synthetic perturbations. This ongoing work supports
curvature-based attribution and early-stage risk-aware ranking, with plans for
portfolio optimization and return forecasting. To our knowledge, RicciFlowRec
is the first recommender to apply geometric flow-based reasoning in financial
decision support.

Result: 在8个基准测试和多种模型上实验表明，AdaPO显著提升了直接推理和自我评估能力。

Conclusion: AdaPO通过自适应机制有效解决了奖励黑客问题，为模型自我改进提供了新方向。

Abstract: Self-evaluation, a model's ability to assess the correctness of its own
output, is crucial for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to achieve
self-improvement in multi-turn conversations, yet largely absent in foundation
models. Recent work has employed reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance
self-evaluation; however, its fixed reward mechanism suffers from reward
hacking when optimizing multiple training objectives, leading to model
collapse. In this paper we propose AdaPO, an online reinforcement learning
framework capable of adaptively adjusting training objective in real time
according to the current training state for each task. Specifically, to
mitigate reward hacking , AdaPO introduces an Adaptive Reward Model (ARM) and a
Reward Aware Dynamic KL Regularization mechanism. ARM assesses the task's
training state from the distribution of model generated multi-turn
trajectories' performance. Reward Aware Dynamic KL replaces a fixed penalty
with dynamic coefficients which is modulated by the reward gap between
different multi-turn situations. Notably, our method automatically and smoothly
adjusts its learning focus based on sub-tasks' training progress without manual
intervention. Extensive experiments over 8 benchmarks and various models show
that our method significantly enhances both direct reasoning and
self-evaluation capability. We will release our code to contribute to the
community.

Abstract: We present a framework for fine-tuning flow-matching generative models to
enforce physical constraints and solve inverse problems in scientific systems.
Starting from a model trained on low-fidelity or observational data, we apply a
differentiable post-training procedure that minimizes weak-form residuals of
governing partial differential equations (PDEs), promoting physical consistency
and adherence to boundary conditions without distorting the underlying learned
distribution. To infer unknown physical inputs, such as source terms, material
parameters, or boundary data, we augment the generative process with a
learnable latent parameter predictor and propose a joint optimization strategy.
The resulting model produces physically valid field solutions alongside
plausible estimates of hidden parameters, effectively addressing ill-posed
inverse problems in a data-driven yet physicsaware manner. We validate our
method on canonical PDE benchmarks, demonstrating improved satisfaction of PDE
constraints and accurate recovery of latent coefficients. Our approach bridges
generative modelling and scientific inference, opening new avenues for
simulation-augmented discovery and data-efficient modelling of physical
systems.

Abstract: Autonomous driving faces significant challenges in achieving human-like
iterative decision-making, which continuously generates, evaluates, and refines
trajectory proposals. Current generation-evaluation frameworks isolate
trajectory generation from quality assessment, preventing iterative refinement
essential for planning, while reinforcement learning methods collapse
multi-dimensional preferences into scalar rewards, obscuring critical
trade-offs and yielding scalarization bias.To overcome these issues, we present
EvaDrive, a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that
establishes genuine closed-loop co-evolution between trajectory generation and
evaluation via adversarial optimization. EvaDrive frames trajectory planning as
a multi-round adversarial game. In this game, a hierarchical generator
continuously proposes candidate paths by combining autoregressive intent
modeling for temporal causality with diffusion-based refinement for spatial
flexibility. These proposals are then rigorously assessed by a trainable
multi-objective critic that explicitly preserves diverse preference structures
without collapsing them into a single scalarization bias.This adversarial
interplay, guided by a Pareto frontier selection mechanism, enables iterative
multi-round refinement, effectively escaping local optima while preserving
trajectory diversity.Extensive experiments on NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks
demonstrate SOTA performance, achieving 94.9 PDMS on NAVSIM v1 (surpassing
DiffusionDrive by 6.8, DriveSuprim by 5.0, and TrajHF by 0.9) and 64.96 Driving
Score on Bench2Drive. EvaDrive generates diverse driving styles via dynamic
weighting without external preference data, introducing a closed-loop
adversarial framework for human-like iterative decision-making, offering a
novel scalarization-free trajectory optimization approach.

Conclusion: 整合的数据集为糖尿病研究提供了重要资源，数据质量和相关性分析为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder that leads to the destruction
of insulin-producing cells, resulting in insulin deficiency, as to why the
affected individuals depend on external insulin injections. However, insulin
can decrease blood glucose levels and can cause hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is a
severe event of low blood glucose levels ($\le$70 mg/dL) with dangerous side
effects of dizziness, coma, or death. Data analysis can significantly enhance
diabetes care by identifying personal patterns and trends leading to adverse
events. Especially, machine learning (ML) models can predict glucose levels and
provide early alarms. However, diabetes and hypoglycemia research is limited by
the unavailability of large datasets. Thus, this work systematically integrates
15 datasets to provide a large database of 2510 subjects with glucose
measurements recorded every 5 minutes. In total, 149 million measurements are
included, of which 4% represent values in the hypoglycemic range. Moreover, two
sub-databases are extracted. Sub-database I includes demographics, and
sub-database II includes heart rate data. The integrated dataset provides an
equal distribution of sex and different age levels. As a further contribution,
data quality is assessed, revealing that data imbalance and missing values
present a significant challenge. Moreover, a correlation study on glucose
levels and heart rate data is conducted, showing a relation between 15 and 55
minutes before hypoglycemia.

Abstract: Accurate energy consumption forecasting is essential for efficient resource
management and sustainability in the building sector. Deep learning models are
highly successful but struggle with limited historical data and become unusable
when historical data are unavailable, such as in newly constructed buildings.
On the other hand, physics-based models, such as EnergyPlus, simulate energy
consumption without relying on historical data but require extensive building
parameter specifications and considerable time to model a building. This paper
introduces a Physics-Guided Memory Network (PgMN), a neural network that
integrates predictions from deep learning and physics-based models to address
their limitations. PgMN comprises a Parallel Projection Layers to process
incomplete inputs, a Memory Unit to account for persistent biases, and a Memory
Experience Module to optimally extend forecasts beyond their input range and
produce output. Theoretical evaluation shows that components of PgMN are
mathematically valid for performing their respective tasks. The PgMN was
evaluated on short-term energy forecasting at an hourly resolution, critical
for operational decision-making in smart grid and smart building systems.
Experimental validation shows accuracy and applicability of PgMN in diverse
scenarios such as newly constructed buildings, missing data, sparse historical
data, and dynamic infrastructure changes. This paper provides a promising
solution for energy consumption forecasting in dynamic building environments,
enhancing model applicability in scenarios where historical data are limited or

Abstract: Next generation advanced nuclear reactors are expected to be smaller both in
size and power output, relying extensively on fully digital instrumentation and
control systems. These reactors will generate a large flow of information in
the form of multivariate time series data, conveying simultaneously various non
linear cyber physical, process, control, sensor, and operational states.
Ensuring data integrity against deception attacks is becoming increasingly
important for networked communication and a requirement for safe and reliable
operation. Current efforts to address replay attacks, almost universally focus
on watermarking or supervised anomaly detection approaches without further
identifying and characterizing the root cause of the anomaly. In addition,
these approaches rely mostly on synthetic data with uncorrelated Gaussian
process and measurement noise and full state feedback or are limited to
univariate signals, signal stationarity, linear quadratic regulators, or other
linear-time invariant state-space which may fail to capture any unmodeled
system dynamics. In the realm of regulated nuclear cyber-physical systems,
additional work is needed on characterization of replay attacks and
explainability of predictions using real data. Here, we propose an unsupervised
explainable AI framework based on a combination of autoencoder and customized
windowSHAP algorithm to fully characterize real-time replay attacks, i.e.,
detection, source identification, timing and type, of increasing complexity
during a dynamic time evolving reactor process. The proposed XAI framework was
benchmarked on several real world datasets from Purdue's nuclear reactor PUR-1
with up to six signals concurrently being replayed. In all cases, the XAI
framework was able to detect and identify the source and number of signals
being replayed and the duration of the falsification with 95 percent or better
accuracy.

Result: 实验表明，ASL方案在32nm工艺下可减少60%以上的能耗和延迟，且精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: ASL方案在物联网应用中具有可行性，并突显了混合精度截断在SC设计中的独特优势。

Abstract: Stochastic computing (SC) has emerged as an efficient low-power alternative
for deploying neural networks (NNs) in resource-limited scenarios, such as the
Internet of Things (IoT). By encoding values as serial bitstreams, SC
significantly reduces energy dissipation compared to conventional
floating-point (FP) designs; however, further improvement of layer-wise
mixed-precision implementation for SC remains unexplored. This article
introduces Adjustable Sequence Length (ASL), a novel scheme that applies
mixed-precision concepts specifically to SC NNs. By introducing an
operator-norm-based theoretical model, this article shows that truncation noise
can cumulatively propagate through the layers by the estimated amplification
factors. An extended sensitivity analysis is presented, using random forest
(RF) regression to evaluate multilayer truncation effects and validate the
alignment of theoretical predictions with practical network behaviors. To
accommodate different application scenarios, this article proposes two
truncation strategies (coarse-grained and fine-grained), which apply diverse
sequence length configurations at each layer. Evaluations on a pipelined SC MLP
synthesized at 32nm demonstrate that ASL can reduce energy and latency
overheads by up to over 60% with negligible accuracy loss. It confirms the
feasibility of the ASL scheme for IoT applications and highlights the distinct
advantages of mixed-precision truncation in SC designs.

Abstract: Population synthesis is a critical task that involves generating synthetic
yet realistic representations of populations. It is a fundamental problem in
agent-based modeling (ABM), which has become the standard to analyze
intelligent transportation systems. The synthetic population serves as the
primary input for ABM transportation simulation, with traveling agents
represented by population members. However, when the number of attributes
describing agents becomes large, survey data often cannot densely support the
joint distribution of the attributes in the population due to the curse of
dimensionality. This sparsity makes it difficult to accurately model and
produce the population. Interestingly, deep generative models trained from
available sample data can potentially synthesize possible attribute
combinations that present in the actual population but do not exist in the
sample data(called sampling zeros). Nevertheless, this comes at the cost of
falsely generating the infeasible attribute combinations that do not exist in
the population (called structural zeros). In this study, a novel diffusion
model-based population synthesis method is proposed to estimate the underlying
joint distribution of a population. This approach enables the recovery of
numerous missing sampling zeros while keeping the generated structural zeros
minimal. Our method is compared with other recently proposed approaches such as
Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
approaches, which have shown success in high dimensional tabular population
synthesis. We assess the performance of the synthesized outputs using a range
of metrics, including marginal distribution similarity, feasibility, and
diversity. The results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms
previous approaches in achieving a better balance between the feasibility and
diversity of the synthesized population.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) as an important tool for diagnosing cardiovascular
diseases such as arrhythmia. Due to the differences in ECG layouts used by
different hospitals, the digitized signals exhibit asynchronous lead time and
partial blackout loss, which poses a serious challenge to existing models. To
address this challenge, the study introduced PatchECG, a framework for adaptive
variable block count missing representation learning based on a masking
training strategy, which automatically focuses on key patches with
collaborative dependencies between leads, thereby achieving key recognition of
arrhythmia in ECGs with different layouts. Experiments were conducted on the
PTB-XL dataset and 21388 asynchronous ECG images generated using ECG image kit
tool, using the 23 Subclasses as labels. The proposed method demonstrated
strong robustness under different layouts, with average Area Under the Receiver
Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.835 and remained stable (unchanged
with layout changes). In external validation based on 400 real ECG images data
from Chaoyang Hospital, the AUROC for atrial fibrillation diagnosis reached
0.778; On 12 x 1 layout ECGs, AUROC reaches 0.893. This result is superior to
various classic interpolation and baseline methods, and compared to the current

Conclusion: FedMP有效提升了非独立同分布数据下的联邦学习性能，并分析了流形维度、通信效率和隐私影响。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning paradigm in which
multiple clients collaboratively train a shared model without sharing their
local private data. However, real-world applications of FL frequently encounter
challenges arising from the non-identically and independently distributed
(non-IID) local datasets across participating clients, which is particularly
pronounced in the field of medical imaging, where shifts in image feature
distributions significantly hinder the global model's convergence and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedMP, a novel method
designed to enhance FL under non-IID scenarios. FedMP employs stochastic
feature manifold completion to enrich the training space of individual client
classifiers, and leverages class-prototypes to guide the alignment of feature
manifolds across clients within semantically consistent subspaces, facilitating
the construction of more distinct decision boundaries. We validate the
effectiveness of FedMP on multiple medical imaging datasets, including those
with real-world multi-center distributions, as well as on a multi-domain
natural image dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that FedMP
outperforms existing FL algorithms. Additionally, we analyze the impact of
manifold dimensionality, communication efficiency, and privacy implications of
feature exposure in our method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态量化训练（DQT）框架，通过嵌套整数表示和自定义整数运算，实现高效动态量化，避免了传统方法中昂贵的浮点运算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态量化方法需要昂贵的浮点运算来切换精度，破坏了整数硬件范式并影响性能。DQT旨在解决这一瓶颈。

Method: DQT采用嵌套整数表示和自定义整数运算，通过低成本位移操作实现动态精度切换，并引入轻量级控制器实时决策量化方式。

Result: 在ImageNet上，4位动态ResNet50达到77.00% top-1准确率，优于静态（LSQ, 76.70%）和动态（DQNET, 76.94%）方法，且计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: DQT为高效自适应AI开辟了新方向，显著提升了动态量化的性能和效率。

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices relies
on quantization. While static, uniform quantization applies a fixed bit-width
to all inputs, it fails to adapt to their varying complexity. Dynamic,
instance-based mixed-precision quantization promises a superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-off by allocating higher precision only when needed.
However, a critical bottleneck remains: existing methods require a costly
dequantize-to-float and requantize-to-integer cycle to change precision,
breaking the integer-only hardware paradigm and compromising performance gains.
This paper introduces Dynamic Quantization Training (DQT), a novel framework
that removes this bottleneck. At the core of DQT is a nested integer
representation where lower-precision values are bit-wise embedded within
higher-precision ones. This design, coupled with custom integer-only
arithmetic, allows for on-the-fly bit-width switching through a near-zero-cost
bit-shift operation. This makes DQT the first quantization framework to enable
both dequantization-free static mixed-precision of the backbone network, and
truly efficient dynamic, instance-based quantization through a lightweight
controller that decides at runtime how to quantize each layer. We demonstrate
DQT state-of-the-art performance on ResNet18 on CIFAR-10 and ResNet50 on
ImageNet. On ImageNet, our 4-bit dynamic ResNet50 achieves 77.00% top-1
accuracy, an improvement over leading static (LSQ, 76.70%) and dynamic (DQNET,
76.94%) methods at a comparable BitOPs budget. Crucially, DQT achieves this
with a bit-width transition cost of only 28.3M simple bit-shift operations, a
drastic improvement over the 56.6M costly Multiply-Accumulate (MAC)
floating-point operations required by previous dynamic approaches - unlocking a
new frontier in efficient, adaptive AI.

Conclusion: scAGC通过自适应图学习和对比指导，显著提升了单细胞聚类性能。

Abstract: Accurate cell type annotation is a crucial step in analyzing single-cell RNA
sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, which provides valuable insights into cellular
heterogeneity. However, due to the high dimensionality and prevalence of zero
elements in scRNA-seq data, traditional clustering methods face significant
statistical and computational challenges. While some advanced methods use graph
neural networks to model cell-cell relationships, they often depend on static
graph structures that are sensitive to noise and fail to capture the
long-tailed distribution inherent in single-cell populations.To address these
limitations, we propose scAGC, a single-cell clustering method that learns
adaptive cell graphs with contrastive guidance. Our approach optimizes feature
representations and cell graphs simultaneously in an end-to-end manner.
Specifically, we introduce a topology-adaptive graph autoencoder that leverages
a differentiable Gumbel-Softmax sampling strategy to dynamically refine the
graph structure during training. This adaptive mechanism mitigates the problem
of a long-tailed degree distribution by promoting a more balanced neighborhood
structure. To model the discrete, over-dispersed, and zero-inflated nature of
scRNA-seq data, we integrate a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) loss for
robust feature reconstruction. Furthermore, a contrastive learning objective is
incorporated to regularize the graph learning process and prevent abrupt
changes in the graph topology, ensuring stability and enhancing convergence.
Comprehensive experiments on 9 real scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate that scAGC
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, yielding the best NMI
and ARI scores on 9 and 7 datasets, respectively.Our code is available at
Anonymous Github.

Conclusion: LCSFLA为车联网中的联邦学习提供了一种高效的客户选择方案，解决了资源浪费和信息不对称问题。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a decentralized framework that enables
universal model training through collaborative efforts on mobile nodes, such as
smart vehicles in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Each smart vehicle acts as a
mobile client, contributing to the process without uploading local data. This
method leverages non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) training
data from different vehicles, influenced by various driving patterns and
environmental conditions, which can significantly impact model convergence and
accuracy. Although client selection can be a feasible solution for non-IID
issues, it faces challenges related to selection metrics. Traditional metrics
evaluate client data quality independently per round and require client
selection after all clients complete local training, leading to resource
wastage from unused training results. In the IoV context, where vehicles have
limited connectivity and computational resources, information asymmetry in
client selection risks clients submitting false information, potentially making
the selection ineffective. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel
Long-term Client-Selection Federated Learning based on Truthful Auction
(LCSFLA). This scheme maximizes social welfare with consideration of long-term
data quality using a new assessment mechanism and energy costs, and the advised
auction mechanism with a deposit requirement incentivizes client participation
and ensures information truthfulness. We theoretically prove the incentive
compatibility and individual rationality of the advised incentive mechanism.
Experimental results on various datasets, including those from IoV scenarios,
demonstrate its effectiveness in mitigating performance degradation caused by
non-IID data.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著降低有害性评分和攻击成功率，且对模型实用性影响极小。

Conclusion: FGSN方法实现了对未知安全问题的持续防御和泛化能力，为LLM微调安全提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning as service injects domain-specific knowledge into large language
models (LLMs), while challenging the original alignment mechanisms and
introducing safety risks. A series of defense strategies have been proposed for
the alignment, fine-tuning, and post-fine-tuning phases, where most
post-fine-tuning defenses rely on coarse-grained safety layer mapping. These
methods lack a comprehensive consideration of both safety layers and
fine-grained neurons, limiting their ability to efficiently balance safety and
utility. To address this, we propose the Fine-Grained Safety Neurons (FGSN)
with Training-Free Continual Projection method to reduce the fine-tuning safety
risks. FGSN inherently integrates the multi-scale interactions between safety
layers and neurons, localizing sparser and more precise fine-grained safety
neurons while minimizing interference with downstream task neurons. We then
project the safety neuron parameters onto safety directions, improving model
safety while aligning more closely with human preferences. Extensive
experiments across multiple fine-tuned LLM models demonstrate that our method
significantly reduce harmfulness scores and attack success rates with minimal
parameter modifications, while preserving the model's utility. Furthermore, by
introducing a task-specific, multi-dimensional heterogeneous safety neuron
cluster optimization mechanism, we achieve continual defense and generalization
capability against unforeseen emerging safety concerns.

Motivation: 时间序列预测在多个关键领域（如能源、医疗和金融）中至关重要，但现有方法难以整合历史数值序列和上下文特征（如非结构化文本数据）。

Conclusion: TokenCast通过统一的语义空间和LLM优化，显著提升了上下文感知时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in supporting decision-making
across a wide range of critical applications, including energy, healthcare, and
finance. Despite recent advances, forecasting accuracy remains limited due to
the challenge of integrating historical numerical sequences with contextual
features, which often comprise unstructured textual data. To address this
challenge, we propose TokenCast, an LLM-driven framework that leverages
language-based symbolic representations as a unified intermediary for
context-aware time series forecasting. Specifically, TokenCast employs a
discrete tokenizer to transform continuous numerical sequences into temporal
tokens, enabling structural alignment with language-based inputs. To bridge the
semantic gap between modalities, both temporal and contextual tokens are
embedded into a shared representation space via a pre-trained large language
model (LLM), further optimized with autoregressive generative objectives.
Building upon this unified semantic space, the aligned LLM is subsequently
fine-tuned in a supervised manner to predict future temporal tokens, which are
then decoded back into the original numerical space. Extensive experiments on
diverse real-world datasets enriched with contextual features demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of TokenCast.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源dLLMs在推理速度上未能超越类似规模的自回归模型（AR LLMs），因此需要一种更高效的解码方法。

Method: D2F策略通过块级自回归生成和跨块并行解码，将dLLMs改造为AR-扩散混合范式，并通过非对称蒸馏实现。

Result: 实验显示，D2F dLLMs在GSM8K上的推理速度比LLaMA3和Qwen2.5快2.5倍以上，比LLaDA和Dream快50倍以上，同时保持输出质量。

Conclusion: D2F成功突破了dLLMs推理速度的瓶颈，为高效文本生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for text generation, with the potential
to decode multiple tokens in a single iteration. However, none of the existing
open-source dLLMs have achieved superior inference speed over AR LLMs of
similar size. This paper breaks this barrier based on a simple and effective
strategy named discrete diffusion forcing (D2F). D2F equips dLLMs with two key
capabilities: (1) block-wise autoregressive generation to enable KV cache
utilization; (2) prediction of following tokens without requiring completion of
prior blocks for inter-block parallel decoding. In this way, the vanilla dLLMs
are refurbished into an AR-diffusion hybrid paradigm for efficient inference.
D2F can be implemented with an asymmetric distillation process based on
pre-trained dLLMs. We further propose a pipelined parallel decoding algorithm,
which enables a trade-off between efficiency and efficacy. Empirically, D2F
dLLMs achieve more than $\mathbf{2.5\times}$ inference speed than LLaMA3 and
Qwen2.5 on GSM8K. Compared to vanilla dLLMs like LLaDA and Dream, the
acceleration can be more than $\mathbf{50\times}$ while maintaining comparable
output quality. The code is available at

Conclusion: MIPCGRL能够处理复杂指令，实现更具表达力和灵活性的内容生成。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative modeling emphasize the importance of
natural language as a highly expressive and accessible modality for controlling
content generation. However, existing instructed reinforcement learning for
procedural content generation (IPCGRL) method often struggle to leverage the
expressive richness of textual input, especially under complex, multi-objective
instructions, leading to limited controllability. To address this problem, we
propose \textit{MIPCGRL}, a multi-objective representation learning method for
instructed content generators, which incorporates sentence embeddings as
conditions. MIPCGRL effectively trains a multi-objective embedding space by
incorporating multi-label classification and multi-head regression networks.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves up to a 13.8\%
improvement in controllability with multi-objective instructions. The ability
to process complex instructions enables more expressive and flexible content
generation.

Conclusion: 这一方法为更民主和经济可行的人工智能解决方案提供了路径。

Abstract: The deployment of large-scale models, such as large language models (LLMs),
incurs substantial costs due to their computational demands. To mitigate these
costs and address challenges related to scalability and data security, there is
a growing shift towards decentralized systems for model deployment, where
choosing efficient inference acceleration schemes become crucial to manage
computational resources effectively and enhance system responsiveness. In this
work, we address the challenge of selecting optimal acceleration methods in
decentralized systems by introducing a meta-learning-based framework. This
framework automates the selection process by learning from historical
performance data of various acceleration techniques across different tasks.
Unlike traditional methods that rely on random selection or expert intuition,
our approach systematically identifies the best acceleration strategies based
on the specific characteristics of each task. We demonstrate that our
meta-learning framework not only streamlines the decision-making process but
also consistently outperforms conventional methods in terms of efficiency and
performance. Our results highlight the potential of inference acceleration in
decentralized AI systems, offering a path towards more democratic and
economically feasible artificial intelligence solutions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ADT4Coupons的新框架，用于优化在线平台的优惠券分发策略，以提升长期收入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优惠券分发策略未能充分利用平台与用户之间的复杂序列交互，导致性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出ADT4Coupons框架，整合通用场景、序列建模和高效迭代更新，直接设计长期收入提升的优惠券分发策略。

Result: 在真实工业数据集、公开数据集和合成数据集上的实验证明了该框架的优越性。

Conclusion: ADT4Coupons能够有效优化在线决策，适用于多种实际营销场景。

Abstract: Coupon distribution is a critical marketing strategy used by online platforms
to boost revenue and enhance user engagement. Regrettably, existing coupon
distribution strategies fall far short of effectively leveraging the complex
sequential interactions between platforms and users. This critical oversight,
despite the abundance of e-commerce log data, has precipitated a performance
plateau. In this paper, we focus on the scene that the platforms make
sequential coupon distribution decision multiple times for various users, with
each user interacting with the platform repeatedly. Based on this marketing
scenario, we propose a novel marketing framework, named Aligned Decision
Transformer for Coupons (ADT4Coupons), to directly devise coupon distribution
policy for long-term revenue boosting. ADT4Coupons enables optimized online
decision-making in a variety of real-world marketing scenarios. It achieves
this by seamlessly integrating three key characteristics, general scenarios,
sequential modeling with more comprehensive historical data, and efficient
iterative updates within a unified framework. Furthermore, empirical results on
real-world industrial dataset, alongside public and synthetic datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our framework.

Abstract: Construction safety research is a critical field in civil engineering, aiming

existing construction safety datasets pose significant challenges to conducting
in-depth analyses. To address this research gap, this paper introduces the
Construction Safety Dataset (CSDataset), a well-organized comprehensive
multi-level dataset that encompasses incidents, inspections, and violations
recorded sourced from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).
This dataset uniquely integrates structured attributes with unstructured
narratives, facilitating a wide range of approaches driven by machine learning
and large language models. We also conduct a preliminary approach benchmarking
and various cross-level analyses using our dataset, offering insights to inform
and enhance future efforts in construction safety. For example, we found that
complaint-driven inspections were associated with a 17.3% reduction in the
likelihood of subsequent incidents. Our dataset and code are released at

Conclusion: MoQE通过专家混合架构有效缓解了量化模型的性能下降问题，为资源受限设备上的深度学习应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Quantization method plays a crucial role in improving model efficiency and
reducing deployment costs, enabling the widespread application of deep learning
models on resource-constrained devices. However, the quantization process
inevitably introduces accuracy degradation. In this paper, we propose Mixture
of Quantization Experts( abbr. MoQE), a quantization inference framework based
on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, aiming to jointly improve the
performance of quantization models. MoQE combines multiple quantization
variants of one full-precision model as specialized "quantization experts" and
dynamically routes input data to the most suitable expert based on its
characteristics. MoQE alleviates the performance degradation commonly seen in
single quantization models through specialization quantization expert models.
We design lightweight, structure-aware router models tailored for both CV and
NLP tasks. Experimental evaluations on ResNet, LLaMA, and Qwen model families
across benchmark datasets including ImageNet, WikiText, C4, and OpenWebText
demonstrate that MoQE achieves performance comparable to SOTA quantization
model, without incurring significant increases in inference latency.

Result: 实验显示，在2000x2000阵列上，转移步骤减少50%，规划时间低于2分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法为AR/VR和下一代显示制造提供了实用且适应性强的微LED修复解决方案。

Abstract: Laser-enabled selective transfer, a key process in high-throughput microLED
fabrication, requires computational models that can plan shift sequences to
minimize motion of XY stages and adapt to varying optimization objectives
across the substrate. We propose the first repair algorithm based on a
differentiable transfer module designed to model discrete shifts of transfer
platforms, while remaining trainable via gradient-based optimization. Compared
to local proximity searching algorithms, our approach achieves superior repair
performance and enables more flexible objective designs, such as minimizing the
number of steps. Unlike reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches, our
method eliminates the need for handcrafted feature extractors and trains
significantly faster, allowing scalability to large arrays. Experiments show a
50% reduction in transfer steps and sub-2-minute planning time on 2000x2000
arrays. This method provides a practical and adaptable solution for

Method: 提出分层自适应网络（Hi-Vec），包括动态层选择、权重合并机制和线性层一致性门控。

Result: 在多个目标数据集上验证了Hi-Vec的优越性，提升了鲁棒性和抗噪声能力。

Conclusion: Hi-Vec为测试时适应提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案，显著提升了现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation allows pretrained models to adjust to incoming data
streams, addressing distribution shifts between source and target domains.
However, standard methods rely on single-dimensional linear classification
layers, which often fail to handle diverse and complex shifts. We propose
Hierarchical Adaptive Networks with Task Vectors (Hi-Vec), which leverages
multiple layers of increasing size for dynamic test-time adaptation. By
decomposing the encoder's representation space into such hierarchically
organized layers, Hi-Vec, in a plug-and-play manner, allows existing methods to
adapt to shifts of varying complexity. Our contributions are threefold: First,
we propose dynamic layer selection for automatic identification of the optimal
layer for adaptation to each test batch. Second, we propose a mechanism that
merges weights from the dynamic layer to other layers, ensuring all layers
receive target information. Third, we propose linear layer agreement that acts
as a gating function, preventing erroneous fine-tuning by adaptation on noisy
batches. We rigorously evaluate the performance of Hi-Vec in challenging
scenarios and on multiple target datasets, proving its strong capability to
advance state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that Hi-Vec improves
robustness, addresses uncertainty, and handles limited batch sizes and
increased outlier rates.

Result: 在吉隆坡真实数据集上，GSMT在短期和长期轨迹预测任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: GSMT为复杂城市交通环境下的公交轨迹预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction for buses is crucial in intelligent
transportation systems, particularly within urban environments. In developing
regions where access to multimodal data is limited, relying solely on onboard
GPS data remains indispensable despite inherent challenges. To address this
problem, we propose GSMT, a hybrid model that integrates a Graph Attention
Network (GAT) with a sequence-to-sequence Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and
incorporates a task corrector capable of extracting complex behavioral patterns
from large-scale trajectory data. The task corrector clusters historical
trajectories to identify distinct motion patterns and fine-tunes the
predictions generated by the GAT and RNN. Specifically, GSMT fuses dynamic bus
information and static station information through embedded hybrid networks to
perform trajectory prediction, and applies the task corrector for secondary
refinement after the initial predictions are generated. This two-stage approach
enables multi-node trajectory prediction among buses operating in dense urban
traffic environments under complex conditions. Experiments conducted on a
real-world dataset from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance
in both short-term and long-term trajectory prediction tasks.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have opened the door to
in-depth investigation of their potential in tabular data modeling. However,
effectively utilizing advanced LLMs in few-shot and even zero-shot scenarios is
still challenging. To this end, we propose a novel LLM-based prototype
estimation framework for tabular learning. Our key idea is to query the LLM to
generate feature values based example-free prompt, which solely relies on task
and feature descriptions. With the feature values generated by LLM, we can
build a zero-shot prototype in a training-free manner, which can be further
enhanced by fusing few-shot samples, avoiding training a classifier or
finetuning the LLMs. Thanks to the example-free prompt and prototype
estimation, ours bypasses the constraints brought by the example-based prompt,
providing a scalable and robust framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of ours in zero and few-shot tabular learning.

Abstract: Odor detection underpins food safety, environmental monitoring, medical
diagnostics, and many more fields. The current artificial sensors developed for
odor detection struggle with complex mixtures while non-invasive recordings
lack reliable single-trial fidelity. To develop a general system for odor
detection, in this study we present a preliminary work where we aim to test two
hypotheses: (i) that spectral features of local field potentials (LFPs) are
sufficient for robust single-trial odor detection and (ii) that signals from
the olfactory bulb alone are adequate. To test two hypotheses, we propose an
ensemble of complementary one-dimensional convolutional networks (ResCNN and
AttentionCNN) that decodes the presence of odor from multichannel olfactory
bulb LFPs. Tested on 2,349 trials from seven awake mice, our final ensemble
model supports both hypotheses, achieving a mean accuracy of 86.6%, an F1-score
of 81.0%, and an AUC of 0.9247, substantially outperforming previous
benchmarks. In addition, the t-SNE visualization confirms that our framework
captures biologically significant signatures. These findings establish the
feasibility of robust single-trial detection of the presence of odor from
extracellular LFPs, as well as demonstrate the potential of deep learning
models to provide a deeper understanding of olfactory representations.

Motivation: 图神经网络在多个领域表现出色，但消息传递GNNs存在长距离信息过度挤压的问题，限制了其表达能力。目前缺乏直接的过度挤压度量方法，因此需要一种严谨的评估工具。

Method: 提出了一种基于节点对间互敏感度衰减率的过度挤压评估方法，并扩展到四种图级统计量。通过因果设计量化重连策略对过度挤压的影响。

Result: 实验表明，大多数图分类数据集存在不同程度的过度挤压，重连技术能有效缓解，但效果因数据集和方法而异。节点分类数据集中过度挤压不明显，重连甚至可能加剧问题。

Conclusion: 重连技术对过度挤压问题有效，但需谨慎使用，尤其是在过度挤压不显著的情况下。论文提供的诊断工具可帮助实践者在训练前判断是否需要重连。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance
across wide-range of domains such as recommender systems, material design, and
drug repurposing. Yet message-passing GNNs suffer from over-squashing --
exponential compression of long-range information from distant nodes -- which
limits expressivity. Rewiring techniques can ease this bottleneck; but their
practical impacts are unclear due to the lack of a direct empirical
over-squashing metric. We propose a rigorous, topology-focused method for
assessing over-squashing between node pairs using the decay rate of their
mutual sensitivity. We then extend these pairwise assessments to four
graph-level statistics (prevalence, intensity, variability, extremity).
Coupling these metrics with a within-graph causal design, we quantify how
rewiring strategies affect over-squashing on diverse graph- and
node-classification benchmarks. Our extensive empirical analyses show that most
graph classification datasets suffer from over-squashing (but to various
extents), and rewiring effectively mitigates it -- though the degree of
mitigation, and its translation into performance gains, varies by dataset and
method. We also found that over-squashing is less notable in node
classification datasets, where rewiring often increases over-squashing, and
performance variations are uncorrelated with over-squashing changes. These
findings suggest that rewiring is most beneficial when over-squashing is both
substantial and corrected with restraint -- while overly aggressive rewiring,
or rewiring applied to minimally over-squashed graphs, is unlikely to help and
may even harm performance. Our plug-and-play diagnostic tool lets practitioners
decide -- before any training -- whether rewiring is likely to pay off.

Conclusion: 本文揭示了c-MARL在现实约束下的新漏洞，并提供了高效的对抗攻击方法，为未来防御研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (c-MARL) has rapidly
evolved, offering state-of-the-art algorithms for real-world applications,
including sensitive domains. However, a key challenge to its widespread
adoption is the lack of a thorough investigation into its vulnerabilities to
adversarial attacks. Existing work predominantly focuses on training-time
attacks or unrealistic scenarios, such as access to policy weights or the
ability to train surrogate policies. In this paper, we investigate new
vulnerabilities under more realistic and constrained conditions, assuming an
adversary can only collect and perturb the observations of deployed agents. We
also consider scenarios where the adversary has no access at all. We propose
simple yet highly effective algorithms for generating adversarial perturbations
designed to misalign how victim agents perceive their environment. Our approach
is empirically validated on three benchmarks and 22 environments, demonstrating
its effectiveness across diverse algorithms and environments. Furthermore, we
show that our algorithm is sample-efficient, requiring only 1,000 samples
compared to the millions needed by previous methods.

Conclusion: 该框架为CS教育提供了一种自动化、可扩展且可解释的知识建模方法，有助于识别学生学习的核心模式。

Abstract: Effective personalized learning in computer science education depends on
accurately modeling what students know and what they need to learn. While
Knowledge Components (KCs) provide a foundation for such modeling, automated KC
extraction from student code is inherently challenging due to insufficient
explainability of discovered KCs and the open-endedness of programming problems
with significant structural variability across student solutions and complex
interactions among programming concepts. In this work, we propose a novel,
explainable framework for automated KC discovery through pattern-based KCs:
recurring structural patterns within student code that capture the specific
programming patterns and language constructs that students must master. Toward
this, we train a Variational Autoencoder to generate important representative
patterns from student code guided by an explainable, attention-based code
representation model that identifies important correct and incorrect pattern
implementations from student code. These patterns are then clustered to form
pattern-based KCs. We evaluate our KCs using two well-established methods
informed by Cognitive Science: learning curve analysis and Deep Knowledge
Tracing (DKT). Experimental results demonstrate meaningful learning
trajectories and significant improvements in DKT predictive performance over
traditional KT methods. This work advances knowledge modeling in CS education
by providing an automated, scalable, and explainable framework for identifying
granular code patterns and algorithmic constructs, essential for student
learning.

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses a large dataset into a small synthetic
dataset such that learning on the synthetic dataset approximates learning on
the original. Training on the distilled dataset can be performed in as little
as one step of gradient descent. We demonstrate that distillation is
generalizable to different tasks by distilling reinforcement learning
environments into one-batch supervised learning datasets. This demonstrates not
only distillation's ability to compress a reinforcement learning task but also
its ability to transform one learning modality (reinforcement learning) into
another (supervised learning). We present a novel extension of proximal policy
optimization for meta-learning and use it in distillation of a
multi-dimensional extension of the classic cart-pole problem, all MuJoCo
environments, and several Atari games. We demonstrate distillation's ability to
compress complex RL environments into one-step supervised learning, explore RL
distillation's generalizability across learner architectures, and demonstrate
distilling an environment into the smallest-possible synthetic dataset.

Abstract: Weather forecasting plays a vital role in disaster preparedness, agriculture,
and resource management, yet current centralized forecasting systems are
increasingly strained by security vulnerabilities, limited scalability, and
susceptibility to single points of failure. To address these challenges, we
propose a decentralized weather forecasting framework that integrates Federated
Learning (FL) with blockchain technology. FL enables collaborative model
training without exposing sensitive local data; this approach enhances privacy
and reduces data transfer overhead. Meanwhile, the Ethereum blockchain ensures
transparent and dependable verification of model updates. To further enhance

but also enhances system resilience and scalability, making it a viable
candidate for deployment in real-world, security-critical environments.

*Minghao Liu,Chia-Hsuan Lu,Marta Kwiatkowska*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种精确的GNN验证方法GNNev，用于对抗性攻击下的属性与结构扰动保障，支持多种聚合函数，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在高风险应用中易受对抗性攻击，现有方法对常见聚合函数的支持不足，因此需要开发更全面的验证方法。

Method: 采用约束求解与边界收紧技术，迭代解决松弛约束满足问题，并利用求解器的增量求解能力提高效率。

Result: GNNev在多个数据集（Cora、CiteSeer、Amazon、Yelp）上验证了其有效性和优越性能，尤其在sum聚合任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: GNNev为GNN提供了对抗性扰动的精确验证支持，填补了现有方法的不足，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes
applications, such as fraud detection or healthcare, but are susceptible to
adversarial attacks. A number of techniques have been proposed to provide
adversarial robustness guarantees, but support for commonly used aggregation
functions in message-passing GNNs is still lacking. In this paper, we develop
an exact (sound and complete) verification method for GNNs to compute
guarantees against attribute and structural perturbations that involve edge
addition or deletion, subject to budget constraints. Focusing on node
classification tasks, our method employs constraint solving with bound
tightening, and iteratively solves a sequence of relaxed constraint
satisfaction problems while relying on incremental solving capabilities of
solvers to improve efficiency. We implement GNNev, a versatile solver for
message-passing neural networks, which supports three aggregation functions,
sum, max and mean, with the latter two considered here for the first time.
Extensive experimental evaluation of GNNev on two standard benchmarks (Cora and
CiteSeer) and two real-world fraud datasets (Amazon and Yelp) demonstrates its
usability and effectiveness, as well as superior performance compared to
existing {exact verification} tools on sum-aggregated node classification
tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于权重大小的突触修剪方法，模拟生物大脑的修剪机制，逐步移除低重要性连接，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物大脑通过突触修剪提高效率，而人工神经网络中的dropout随机失活神经元，缺乏活动依赖性修剪。

Method: 提出基于权重大小的修剪方法，通过立方调度逐步增加全局稀疏性，定期永久移除低重要性权重。

Result: 在多个时间序列预测模型上表现优异，金融预测中平均绝对误差降低高达20%-52%。

Conclusion: 该方法将权重消除与渐进稀疏化结合，易于集成到不同架构中，是传统dropout的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Synaptic pruning in biological brains removes weak connections to improve
efficiency. In contrast, dropout regularization in artificial neural networks
randomly deactivates neurons without considering activity-dependent pruning. We
propose a magnitude-based synaptic pruning method that better reflects biology
by progressively removing low-importance connections during training.
Integrated directly into the training loop as a dropout replacement, our
approach computes weight importance from absolute magnitudes across layers and
applies a cubic schedule to gradually increase global sparsity. At fixed
intervals, pruning masks permanently remove low-importance weights while
maintaining gradient flow for active ones, eliminating the need for separate
pruning and fine-tuning phases. Experiments on multiple time series forecasting
models including RNN, LSTM, and Patch Time Series Transformer across four
datasets show consistent gains. Our method ranked best overall, with
statistically significant improvements confirmed by Friedman tests (p < 0.01).
In financial forecasting, it reduced Mean Absolute Error by up to 20% over
models with no or standard dropout, and up to 52% in select transformer models.
This dynamic pruning mechanism advances regularization by coupling weight
elimination with progressive sparsification, offering easy integration into
diverse architectures. Its strong performance, especially in financial time
series forecasting, highlights its potential as a practical alternative to
conventional dropout techniques.

*Charles O'Neill,Mudith Jayasekara,Max Kirkby*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出通过限制稀疏自编码器（SAEs）的训练领域（如医学文本），可以提升特征重建的保真度和可解释性，减少线性残差，并揭示更具临床意义的潜在特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器（SAEs）在广泛数据分布上训练时，固定的潜在预算只能捕捉高频通用模式，导致线性残差大且潜在特征难以解释。论文旨在通过领域限制（如医学文本）解决这一问题。

Method: 研究使用JumpReLU SAEs在Gemma-2模型的第20层激活上训练，数据为19.5万临床问答示例，对比了领域限制与广泛领域SAEs的表现。

Result: 领域限制的SAEs在方差解释、损失恢复和线性残差减少方面表现更优，潜在特征与临床概念（如“味觉”或“传染性单核细胞增多症”）更相关。

Conclusion: 领域限制能缓解广泛领域SAEs的局限性，提供更完整和可解释的潜在分解，并质疑通用SAEs的“基础模型”扩展需求。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose large language model (LLM) activations
into latent features that reveal mechanistic structure. Conventional SAEs train
on broad data distributions, forcing a fixed latent budget to capture only
high-frequency, generic patterns. This often results in significant linear
``dark matter'' in reconstruction error and produces latents that fragment or
absorb each other, complicating interpretation. We show that restricting SAE
training to a well-defined domain (medical text) reallocates capacity to
domain-specific features, improving both reconstruction fidelity and
interpretability. Training JumpReLU SAEs on layer-20 activations of Gemma-2
models using 195k clinical QA examples, we find that domain-confined SAEs
explain up to 20\% more variance, achieve higher loss recovery, and reduce
linear residual error compared to broad-domain SAEs. Automated and human
evaluations confirm that learned features align with clinically meaningful
concepts (e.g., ``taste sensations'' or ``infectious mononucleosis''), rather
than frequent but uninformative tokens. These domain-specific SAEs capture
relevant linear structure, leaving a smaller, more purely nonlinear residual.
We conclude that domain-confinement mitigates key limitations of broad-domain
SAEs, enabling more complete and interpretable latent decompositions, and
suggesting the field may need to question ``foundation-model'' scaling for
general-purpose SAEs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索文本到图像模型是否能够将病理语音（如痴呆相关语音）与生成的图像对齐，并开发解释这种对齐的方法。

Method: 利用文本到图像模型分析痴呆相关语音信息与生成图像的对齐能力，并应用可解释性方法揭示语言中的关键部分。

Result: 在ADReSS数据集上，仅通过生成的图像即可实现75%的痴呆检测准确率。

Conclusion: 文本到图像模型在病理语音与图像对齐方面具有潜力，为痴呆检测提供了新方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image models generate highly realistic images based on natural
language descriptions and millions of users use them to create and share images
online. While it is expected that such models can align input text and
generated image in the same latent space little has been done to understand
whether this alignment is possible between pathological speech and generated
images. In this work, we examine the ability of such models to align
dementia-related speech information with the generated images and develop
methods to explain this alignment. Surprisingly, we found that dementia
detection is possible from generated images alone achieving 75% accuracy on the
ADReSS dataset. We then leverage explainability methods to show which parts of
the language contribute to the detection.

Conclusion: 该方法在敏感金融环境中展现出强大的建模能力和实用价值，同时提升了风险识别的范围和效率。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of data privacy and collaborative
modeling in cross-institution financial risk analysis. It proposes a risk
assessment framework based on federated learning. Without sharing raw data, the
method enables joint modeling and risk identification across multiple
institutions. This is achieved by incorporating a feature attention mechanism
and temporal modeling structure. Specifically, the model adopts a distributed
optimization strategy. Each financial institution trains a local sub-model. The
model parameters are protected using differential privacy and noise injection
before being uploaded. A central server then aggregates these parameters to
generate a global model. This global model is used for systemic risk
identification. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, multiple
experiments are conducted. These evaluate communication efficiency, model
accuracy, systemic risk detection, and cross-market generalization. The results
show that the proposed model outperforms both traditional centralized methods
and existing federated learning variants across all evaluation metrics. It
demonstrates strong modeling capabilities and practical value in sensitive
financial environments. The method enhances the scope and efficiency of risk
identification while preserving data sovereignty. It offers a secure and
efficient solution for intelligent financial risk analysis.

Result: 在真实云监控数据上表现优于现有模型，捕捉异常传播路径和动态行为序列能力更强。

Conclusion: 方法具有较强表达力和稳定性，实际部署潜力高。

Abstract: This study proposes an unsupervised anomaly detection method for distributed
backend service systems, addressing practical challenges such as complex
structural dependencies, diverse behavioral evolution, and the absence of
labeled data. The method constructs a dynamic graph based on service invocation
relationships and applies graph convolution to extract high-order structural
representations from multi-hop topologies. A Transformer is used to model the
temporal behavior of each node, capturing long-term dependencies and local
fluctuations. During the feature fusion stage, a learnable joint embedding
mechanism integrates structural and behavioral representations into a unified
anomaly vector. A nonlinear mapping is then applied to compute anomaly scores,
enabling an end-to-end detection process without supervision. Experiments on
real-world cloud monitoring data include sensitivity analyses across different
graph depths, sequence lengths, and data perturbations. Results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing models on several key metrics,
demonstrating stronger expressiveness and stability in capturing anomaly
propagation paths and modeling dynamic behavior sequences, with high potential
for practical deployment.

Result: 实验表明，NeuronTune在安全性和实用性上均显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: NeuronTune通过细粒度神经元调控，实现了安全性与实用性的高效平衡，为模型部署提供了灵活解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring robust safety alignment while preserving utility is critical for the
reliable deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current
techniques fundamentally suffer from intertwined deficiencies: insufficient
robustness against malicious attacks, frequent refusal of benign queries,
degradation in generated text quality and general task performance--the former
two reflecting deficits in robust safety and the latter constituting utility
impairment. We trace these limitations to the coarse-grained layer-wise
interventions in existing methods. To resolve this, we propose NeuronTune, a
fine-grained framework that dynamically modulates sparse neurons to achieve
simultaneous safety-utility optimization. Our approach first identifies
safety-critical and utility-preserving neurons across all layers via
attribution, then employs meta-learning to adaptively amplify safety-neuron
activations and suppress utility-neuron activations. Crucially, NeuronTune
enables tunable adjustment of intervention scope via neuron-count thresholds,
supporting flexible adaptation to security-critical or utility-priority
scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art technologies, achieving
superior model safety while maintaining excellent utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的许多交互是基于群体的（如多作者论文或用户联合参与项目），传统超图神经网络因固定层数限制长距离依赖捕获且训练不稳定。

Method: 引入隐式超图神经网络（IHGNN），通过非线性固定点方程计算表示，避免深层架构，提出收敛性可证明的训练方案，分析模型表达能力和过平滑条件，并推导超图上的转导泛化界。

Conclusion: IHGNN为高阶关系学习提供了稳定、高效的全局传播方法，具有强泛化能力和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Many real-world interactions are group-based rather than pairwise such as
papers with multiple co-authors and users jointly engaging with items.
Hypergraph neural networks have shown great promise at modeling higher-order
relations, but their reliance on a fixed number of explicit message-passing
layers limits long-range dependency capture and can destabilize training as
depth grows. In this work, we introduce Implicit Hypergraph Neural Networks
(IHGNN), which bring the implicit equilibrium formulation to hypergraphs:
instead of stacking layers, IHGNN computes representations as the solution to a
nonlinear fixed-point equation, enabling stable and efficient global
propagation across hyperedges without deep architectures. We develop a
well-posed training scheme with provable convergence, analyze the oversmoothing
conditions and expressivity of the model, and derive a transductive
generalization bound on hypergraphs. We further present an implicit-gradient
training procedure coupled with a projection-based stabilization strategy.
Extensive experiments on citation benchmarks show that IHGNN consistently
outperforms strong traditional graph/hypergraph neural network baselines in
both accuracy and robustness. Empirically, IHGNN is resilient to random
initialization and hyperparameter variation, highlighting its strong
generalization and practical value for higher-order relational learning.

Result: 在洛杉矶地区195个传感器数据上测试，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NEXICA在准确性和计算速度上均优于现有技术。

Abstract: Road traffic congestion is a persistent problem. Focusing resources on the
causes of congestion is a potentially efficient strategy for reducing
slowdowns. We present NEXICA, an algorithm to discover which parts of the
highway system tend to cause slowdowns on other parts of the highway. We use
time series of road speeds as inputs to our causal discovery algorithm. Finding
other algorithms inadequate, we develop a new approach that is novel in three
ways. First, it concentrates on just the presence or absence of events in the
time series, where an event indicates the temporal beginning of a traffic
slowdown. Second, we develop a probabilistic model using maximum likelihood
estimation to compute the probabilities of spontaneous and caused slowdowns
between two locations on the highway. Third, we train a binary classifier to
identify pairs of cause/effect locations trained on pairs of road locations
where we are reasonably certain a priori of their causal connections, both
positive and negative. We test our approach on six months of road speed data
from 195 different highway speed sensors in the Los Angeles area, showing that
our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and
computation speed.

Motivation: 探索对比方法和生成方法在多元时间序列自监督学习中的互补潜力，解决高类内相似性和大数据依赖问题。

Method: 提出Contrastive Generative Time series框架（CoGenT），通过联合对比-生成优化统一两种范式。

Result: 在六大数据集上，CoGenT比SimCLR和MAE分别提升59.2%和14.27%的F1分数。

Conclusion: CoGenT为时间域混合自监督学习奠定了基础，兼具判别力和生成鲁棒性。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) for multivariate time series mainly includes
two paradigms: contrastive methods that excel at instance discrimination and
generative approaches that model data distributions. While effective
individually, their complementary potential remains unexplored. We propose a
Contrastive Generative Time series framework (CoGenT), the first framework to
unify these paradigms through joint contrastive-generative optimization. CoGenT
addresses fundamental limitations of both approaches: it overcomes contrastive
learning's sensitivity to high intra-class similarity in temporal data while
reducing generative methods' dependence on large datasets. We evaluate CoGenT
on six diverse time series datasets. The results show consistent improvements,
with up to 59.2% and 14.27% F1 gains over standalone SimCLR and MAE,
respectively. Our analysis reveals that the hybrid objective preserves
discriminative power while acquiring generative robustness. These findings
establish a foundation for hybrid SSL in temporal domains. We will release the
code shortly.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在未知故障识别和已知状态分类上表现优异。

Conclusion: FGCRN模型能有效解决多模式过程中的故障诊断问题，尤其在未知故障识别方面表现突出。

Abstract: A reliable fault diagnosis system should not only accurately classify known
health states but also effectively identify unknown faults. In multimode
processes, samples belonging to the same health state often show multiple
cluster distributions, making it difficult to construct compact and accurate
decision boundaries for that state. To address this challenge, a novel open-set
fault diagnosis model named fine-grained clustering and rejection network
(FGCRN) is proposed. It combines multiscale depthwise convolution,
bidirectional gated recurrent unit and temporal attention mechanism to capture
discriminative features. A distance-based loss function is designed to enhance
the intra-class compactness. Fine-grained feature representations are
constructed through unsupervised learning to uncover the intrinsic structures
of each health state. Extreme value theory is employed to model the distance
between sample features and their corresponding fine-grained representations,
enabling effective identification of unknown faults. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.

Conclusion: GraB-NAS通过创新搜索策略解决了Meta-NAS的局限性，为任务感知架构设计提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) automates the design of high-performing
neural networks but typically targets a single predefined task, thereby
restricting its real-world applicability. To address this, Meta Neural
Architecture Search (Meta-NAS) has emerged as a promising paradigm that
leverages prior knowledge across tasks to enable rapid adaptation to new ones.
Nevertheless, existing Meta-NAS methods often struggle with poor
generalization, limited search spaces, or high computational costs. In this
paper, we propose a novel Meta-NAS framework, GraB-NAS. Specifically, GraB-NAS
first models neural architectures as graphs, and then a hybrid search strategy
is developed to find and generate new graphs that lead to promising neural
architectures. The search strategy combines global architecture search via
Bayesian Optimization in the search space with local exploration for novel
neural networks via gradient ascent in the latent space. Such a hybrid search
strategy allows GraB-NAS to discover task-aware architectures with strong
performance, even beyond the predefined search space. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that GraB-NAS outperforms state-of-the-art Meta-NAS baselines,
achieving better generalization and search effectiveness.

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are ubiquitous technologies deployed across
smart cities, industrial sites, and healthcare systems. They continuously
generate time series data that enable advanced analytics and automation in
industries. However, challenges such as the loss or ambiguity of sensor
metadata, heterogeneity in data sources, varying sampling frequencies,
inconsistent units of measurement, and irregular timestamps make raw IoT time
series data difficult to interpret, undermining the effectiveness of smart
systems. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning model,
DeepFeatIoT, which integrates learned local and global features with
non-learned randomized convolutional kernel-based features and features from
large language models (LLMs). This straightforward yet unique fusion of diverse
learned and non-learned features significantly enhances IoT time series sensor
data classification, even in scenarios with limited labeled data. Our model's
effectiveness is demonstrated through its consistent and generalized
performance across multiple real-world IoT sensor datasets from diverse
critical application domains, outperforming state-of-the-art benchmark models.
These results highlight DeepFeatIoT's potential to drive significant
advancements in IoT analytics and support the development of next-generation
smart systems.

Conclusion: 该框架为联邦持续学习中基础模型的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) for Foundation Models (FMs) is an essential yet
underexplored challenge, especially in Federated Continual Learning (FCL),
where each client learns from a private, evolving task stream under strict data
and communication constraints. Despite their powerful generalization abilities,
FMs often exhibit suboptimal performance on local downstream tasks, as they are
unable to utilize private local data. Furthermore, enabling FMs to learn new
tasks without forgetting prior knowledge is inherently a challenging problem,
primarily due to their immense parameter count and high model complexity. In
contrast, small models can be trained locally under resource-constrained
conditions and benefit from more mature CL techniques. To bridge the gap
between small models and FMs, we propose the first collaborative framework in

Abstract: Quantized Neural Networks (QNN) with extremely low-bitwidth data have proven
promising in efficient storage and computation on edge devices. To further
reduce the accuracy drop while increasing speedup, layer-wise mixed-precision
quantization (MPQ) becomes a popular solution. However, existing algorithms for
exploring MPQ schemes are limited in flexibility and efficiency. Comprehending
the complex impacts of different MPQ schemes on post-training quantization and
quantization-aware training results is a challenge for conventional methods.
Furthermore, an end-to-end framework for the optimization and deployment of MPQ
models is missing in existing work.
  In this paper, we propose the MiCo framework, a holistic MPQ exploration and
deployment framework for edge AI applications. The framework adopts a novel
optimization algorithm to search for optimal quantization schemes with the
highest accuracies while meeting latency constraints. Hardware-aware latency
models are built for different hardware targets to enable fast explorations.
After the exploration, the framework enables direct deployment from PyTorch MPQ
models to bare-metal C codes, leading to end-to-end speedup with minimal
accuracy drops.

*Arun Vignesh Malarkkan,Haoyue Bai,Dongjie Wang,Yanjie Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CGAD是一种基于因果图的异常检测框架，用于公共基础设施系统中的网络攻击检测，通过因果分析和图结构比较显著提高了检测精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着针对关键基础设施的网络攻击日益复杂，传统方法在分布偏移和类别不平衡问题上表现不佳，亟需更可靠的异常检测策略。

Method: CGAD采用两阶段监督框架：1) 使用动态贝叶斯网络学习因果不变图结构；2) 通过因果图比较检测异常。

Result: CGAD在非平稳和不平衡时间序列环境中表现优异，F1和ROC-AUC分数显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CGAD通过揭示因果结构，不仅提高了检测精度，还重新定义了异常检测的鲁棒性，适用于复杂和延迟的异常检测。

Abstract: With the growing complexity of cyberattacks targeting critical
infrastructures such as water treatment networks, there is a pressing need for
robust anomaly detection strategies that account for both system
vulnerabilities and evolving attack patterns. Traditional methods --
statistical, density-based, and graph-based models struggle with distribution
shifts and class imbalance in multivariate time series, often leading to high
false positive rates. To address these challenges, we propose CGAD, a Causal
Graph-based Anomaly Detection framework designed for reliable cyberattack
detection in public infrastructure systems. CGAD follows a two-phase supervised
framework -- causal profiling and anomaly scoring. First, it learns causal
invariant graph structures representing the system's behavior under "Normal"
and "Attack" states using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. Second, it employs
structural divergence to detect anomalies via causal graph comparison by
evaluating topological deviations in causal graphs over time. By leveraging
causal structures, CGAD achieves superior adaptability and accuracy in
non-stationary and imbalanced time series environments compared to conventional
machine learning approaches. By uncovering causal structures beneath volatile
sensor data, our framework not only detects cyberattacks with markedly higher
precision but also redefines robustness in anomaly detection, proving
resilience where traditional models falter under imbalance and drift. Our
framework achieves substantial gains in F1 and ROC-AUC scores over
best-performing baselines across four industrial datasets, demonstrating robust
detection of delayed and structurally complex anomalies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Gauss-Tin的新方法，通过结合回放策略和高斯混合模型，优化样本选择，并辅以指导性生成，以提升大型语言模型（LLMs）的知识保留能力。实验结果显示，该方法在保留指标上比传统方法提高了6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）取得了显著进展，但灾难性遗忘（catastrophic forgetting）仍是一个重大挑战。模型在学习新知识时会丢失之前学到的内容。持续学习（CL）策略，尤其是基于回放的方法，为解决这一问题提供了潜力。

Method: Gauss-Tin方法结合了回放策略和高斯混合模型，优化训练中的样本选择，并通过指导性生成辅助过去学习的生成。

Result: 实验结果表明，Gauss-Tin在保留指标上比传统方法提高了6%，有效缓解了灾难性遗忘问题。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了混合模型在动态学习环境中增强LLMs鲁棒性和适应性方面的潜力。

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs),
catastrophic forgetting remains a substantial challenge, where models lose
previously acquired knowledge upon learning new information. Continual learning
(CL) strategies have emerged as a potential solution to this problem, with
replay-based techniques demonstrating superior performance in preserving
learned knowledge. In this context, we introduce Gauss-Tin, a novel approach
that integrates the replay strategy with a Gaussian mixture model to enhance
the quality of sample selection during training, supplemented by instructional
guidance to facilitate the generation of past learning. This method aims to
improve LLMs' retention capabilities by strategically reinforcing important
past learnings while accommodating new information. Our experimental results
indicate a promising 6\% improvement in retention metrics over traditional
methods, suggesting that Gauss-Tin is an effective strategy for mitigating
catastrophic forgetting in LLMs. This study underscores the potential of hybrid
models in enhancing the robustness and adaptability of LLMs in dynamic learning
environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）的统一、可解释的预测性业务流程监控（PBPM）框架，解决了现有方法在局部建模、时间相关性和语义捕捉上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GNN-based PBPM模型在捕捉结构依赖时存在局限性，如忽略时间相关性和转移语义，导致性能不足。

Method: 通过比较局部和全局建模的性能差距，引入时间衰减注意力机制和转移类型语义嵌入，构建动态预测窗口和多级可解释模块。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，模型在不进行数据集调优的情况下，取得了具有竞争力的Top-k准确率和DL分数。

Conclusion: 该框架通过解决架构、时间和语义上的不足，为PBPM中的下一事件预测提供了鲁棒、通用且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Predictive Business Process Monitoring (PBPM) aims to forecast future events
in ongoing cases based on historical event logs. While Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) are well suited to capture structural dependencies in process data,
existing GNN-based PBPM models remain underdeveloped. Most rely either on short
prefix subgraphs or global architectures that overlook temporal relevance and
transition semantics. We propose a unified, interpretable GNN framework that
advances the state of the art along three key axes. First, we compare
prefix-based Graph Convolutional Networks(GCNs) and full trace Graph Attention
Networks(GATs) to quantify the performance gap between localized and global
modeling. Second, we introduce a novel time decay attention mechanism that
constructs dynamic, prediction-centered windows, emphasizing temporally
relevant history and suppressing noise. Third, we embed transition type
semantics into edge features to enable fine grained reasoning over structurally
ambiguous traces. Our architecture includes multilevel interpretability
modules, offering diverse visualizations of attention behavior. Evaluated on
five benchmarks, the proposed models achieve competitive Top-k accuracy and DL
scores without per-dataset tuning. By addressing architectural, temporal, and
semantic gaps, this work presents a robust, generalizable, and explainable
solution for next event prediction in PBPM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种分层联邦微调框架，用于动态车联网（IoV）场景中的多任务适应，通过低秩适应（LoRA）和UCB-DUAL算法实现资源感知和移动弹性学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车联网系统中，由于客户端移动性、资源异构性和间歇性连接，实现高效低延迟的多任务适应具有挑战性。

Method: 提出分层联邦微调框架，结合LoRA和UCB-DUAL算法，解决资源感知和移动弹性问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在延迟降低24%以上、平均准确率提高2.5%的情况下，实现了最佳精度-效率权衡。

Conclusion: 该框架在动态车联网场景中表现出色，为多任务适应提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning has emerged as a promising approach for adapting
foundation models (FMs) to diverse downstream tasks in edge environments. In
Internet of Vehicles (IoV) systems, enabling efficient and low-latency
multi-task adaptation is particularly challenging due to client mobility,
heterogeneous resources, and intermittent connectivity. This paper proposes a
hierarchical federated fine-tuning framework that coordinates roadside units
(RSUs) and vehicles to support resource-aware and mobility-resilient learning
across dynamic IoV scenarios. Leveraging Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we
introduce a decentralized, energy-aware rank adaptation mechanism formulated as
a constrained multi-armed bandit problem. A novel UCB-DUAL algorithm is
developed to enable adaptive exploration under per-task energy budgets,
achieving provable sublinear regret. To evaluate our method, we construct a
large-scale IoV simulator based on real-world trajectories, capturing dynamic
participation, RSU handoffs, and communication variability. Extensive
experiments show that our approach achieves the best accuracy-efficiency
trade-off among all baselines, reducing latency by over 24\% and improving
average accuracy by more than 2.5\%.

Result: 在SST2和MHS数据集上，SYNAPSE-G在发现正标签方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SYNAPSE-G通过合成数据和标签传播有效解决了罕见事件分类的数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Scarcity of labeled data, especially for rare events, hinders training
effective machine learning models. This paper proposes SYNAPSE-G (Synthetic
Augmentation for Positive Sampling via Expansion on Graphs), a novel pipeline
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic training data for
rare event classification, addressing the cold-start problem. This synthetic
data serve as seeds for semi-supervised label propagation on a similarity graph
constructed between the seeds and a large unlabeled dataset. This identifies
candidate positive examples, subsequently labeled by an oracle (human or LLM).
The expanded dataset then trains/fine-tunes a classifier. We theoretically
analyze how the quality (validity and diversity) of the synthetic data impacts
the precision and recall of our method. Experiments on the imbalanced SST2 and
MHS datasets demonstrate SYNAPSE-G's effectiveness in finding positive labels,
outperforming baselines including nearest neighbor search.

Motivation: 探索世界模型在无线边缘计算中的潜力，以提升边缘智能系统的自主性和优化能力。

Method: 分析世界模型的架构基础（如潜在表示学习、动态建模和基于想象的规划），并展示其在EGI场景中的主动应用。

Conclusion: 世界模型是EGI的认知核心，但仍需解决安全性、训练效率和部署限制等挑战，为未来智能边缘系统提供理论和实践指导。

Abstract: Edge General Intelligence (EGI) represents a transformative evolution of edge
computing, where distributed agents possess the capability to perceive, reason,
and act autonomously across diverse, dynamic environments. Central to this
vision are world models, which act as proactive internal simulators that not
only predict but also actively imagine future trajectories, reason under
uncertainty, and plan multi-step actions with foresight. This proactive nature
allows agents to anticipate potential outcomes and optimize decisions ahead of
real-world interactions. While prior works in robotics and gaming have
showcased the potential of world models, their integration into the wireless
edge for EGI remains underexplored. This survey bridges this gap by offering a
comprehensive analysis of how world models can empower agentic artificial
intelligence (AI) systems at the edge. We first examine the architectural
foundations of world models, including latent representation learning, dynamics
modeling, and imagination-based planning. Building on these core capabilities,
we illustrate their proactive applications across EGI scenarios such as
vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, the Internet of
Things (IoT) systems, and network functions virtualization, thereby
highlighting how they can enhance optimization under latency, energy, and
privacy constraints. We then explore their synergy with foundation models and
digital twins, positioning world models as the cognitive backbone of EGI.
Finally, we highlight open challenges, such as safety guarantees, efficient
training, and constrained deployment, and outline future research directions.
This survey provides both a conceptual foundation and a practical roadmap for
realizing the next generation of intelligent, autonomous edge systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有选择性预测模型允许预测者在任意时间开始预测，但现实中预测者可能只能在特定时间窗口内预测，因此需要研究受限情况下的预测性能。

Method: 提出PLS模型，分析实例依赖和平均情况下的最优预测误差，并引入一种复杂度度量方法。

Result: 对于随机生成的PLS实例，复杂度度量方法能高概率匹配实例依赖的最优误差界限。

Conclusion: PLS模型为有限选择性预测提供了理论框架，复杂度度量方法在实际应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: Selective prediction [Dru13, QV19] models the scenario where a forecaster
freely decides on the prediction window that their forecast spans. Many data
statistics can be predicted to a non-trivial error rate without any
distributional assumptions or expert advice, yet these results rely on that the
forecaster may predict at any time. We introduce a model of Prediction with
Limited Selectivity (PLS) where the forecaster can start the prediction only on
a subset of the time horizon. We study the optimal prediction error both on an
instance-by-instance basis and via an average-case analysis. We introduce a
complexity measure that gives instance-dependent bounds on the optimal error.
For a randomly-generated PLS instance, these bounds match with high
probability.

Result: 实验表明，高因果容量的状态与预期子目标一致，GDCC在多目标任务中显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GDCC框架通过因果容量和子目标引导，实现了高效且有目的的环境探索。

Abstract: Causal inference is crucial for humans to explore the world, which can be
modeled to enable an agent to efficiently explore the environment in
reinforcement learning. Existing research indicates that establishing the
causality between action and state transition will enhance an agent to reason
how a policy affects its future trajectory, thereby promoting directed
exploration. However, it is challenging to measure the causality due to its
intractability in the vast state-action space of complex scenarios. In this
paper, we propose a novel Goal Discovery with Causal Capacity (GDCC) framework
for efficient environment exploration. Specifically, we first derive a
measurement of causality in state space, \emph{i.e.,} causal capacity, which
represents the highest influence of an agent's behavior on future trajectories.
After that, we present a Monte Carlo based method to identify critical points
in discrete state space and further optimize this method for continuous
high-dimensional environments. Those critical points are used to uncover where
the agent makes important decisions in the environment, which are then regarded
as our subgoals to guide the agent to make exploration more purposefully and
efficiently. Empirical results from multi-objective tasks demonstrate that
states with high causal capacity align with our expected subgoals, and our GDCC
achieves significant success rate improvements compared to baselines.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) efficiently and accurately
remains a cornerstone challenge in science and engineering, especially for
problems involving complex geometries and limited labeled data. We introduce a
Physics- and Geometry- Aware Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Operator
($\pi$G-Sp$^2$GNO) for learning the solution operators of time-independent and
time-dependent PDEs. The proposed approach first improves upon the recently
developed Sp$^2$GNO by enabling geometry awareness and subsequently exploits
the governing physics to learn the underlying solution operator in a
simulation-free setup. While the spatio-spectral structure present in the
proposed architecture allows multiscale learning, two separate strategies for
enabling geometry awareness is introduced in this paper. For time dependent
problems, we also introduce a novel hybrid physics informed loss function that
combines higher-order time-marching scheme with upscaled theory inspired
stochastic projection scheme. This allows accurate integration of the
physics-information into the loss function. The performance of the proposed
approach is illustrated on number of benchmark examples involving regular and
complex domains, variation in geometry during inference, and time-independent
and time-dependent problems. The results obtained illustrate the efficacy of
the proposed approach as compared to the state-of-the-art physics-informed
neural operator algorithms in the literature.

TL;DR: TimeMKG是一个多模态因果推理框架，通过结合变量语义和历史观测数据提升时间序列建模的鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列模型忽略变量名称和描述的语义信息，而这些信息对建模至关重要。TimeMKG旨在利用这些语义知识提升模型性能。

Method: TimeMKG使用大语言模型解析变量语义，构建多变量知识图谱，并通过双模态编码器分别建模语义提示和统计模式，最后通过跨模态注意力融合表示。

Result: 实验表明，引入变量级知识显著提升了预测性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: TimeMKG通过融合语义和统计信息，为时间序列建模提供了更鲁棒和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Multivariate time series data typically comprises two distinct modalities:
variable semantics and sampled numerical observations. Traditional time series
models treat variables as anonymous statistical signals, overlooking the rich
semantic information embedded in variable names and data descriptions. However,
these textual descriptors often encode critical domain knowledge that is
essential for robust and interpretable modeling. Here we present TimeMKG, a
multimodal causal reasoning framework that elevates time series modeling from
low-level signal processing to knowledge informed inference. TimeMKG employs
large language models to interpret variable semantics and constructs structured
Multivariate Knowledge Graphs that capture inter-variable relationships. A
dual-modality encoder separately models the semantic prompts, generated from
knowledge graph triplets, and the statistical patterns from historical time
series. Cross-modality attention aligns and fuses these representations at the
variable level, injecting causal priors into downstream tasks such as
forecasting and classification, providing explicit and interpretable priors to
guide model reasoning. The experiment in diverse datasets demonstrates that
incorporating variable-level knowledge significantly improves both predictive
performance and generalization.

TL;DR: Thermal Tracks是一个基于Python的统计框架，用于分析蛋白质热稳定性数据，克服了现有热蛋白质组分析（TPP）方法的关键限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TPP方法假设蛋白质熔解曲线为S型，并受限于经验零分布，导致仅能检测约5%的数据。Thermal Tracks旨在解决这一问题，提供更灵活且无偏的分析方法。

Method: 采用高斯过程（GP）模型和平方指数核，灵活建模任意熔解曲线形状，并通过核先验生成无偏零分布。

Result: Thermal Tracks特别适用于分析显著改变蛋白质热稳定性的全蛋白质组扰动（如通路抑制、基因修饰或环境压力），并能有效分析非传统熔解曲线的蛋白质（如相分离蛋白和膜蛋白）。

Conclusion: Thermal Tracks是一个免费、灵活且易于使用的工具，为全蛋白质组热稳定性研究提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Thermal Tracks is a Python-based statistical framework for analyzing protein
thermal stability data that overcomes key limitations of existing thermal
proteome profiling (TPP) work-flows. Unlike standard approaches that assume
sigmoidal melting curves and are constrained by empirical null distributions
(limiting significant hits to approximately 5 % of data), Thermal Tracks uses
Gaussian Process (GP) models with squared-exponential kernels to flexibly model
any melting curve shape while generating unbiased null distributions through
kernel priors. This framework is particularly valuable for analyzing
proteome-wide perturbations that significantly alter protein thermal stability,
such as pathway inhibitions, genetic modifications, or environmental stresses,
where conventional TPP methods may miss biologically relevant changes due to
their statistical constraints. Furthermore, Thermal Tracks excels at analyzing
proteins with un-conventional melting profiles, including phase-separating
proteins and membrane proteins, which often exhibit complex, non-sigmoidal
thermal stability behaviors. Thermal Tracks is freely available from GitHub and
is implemented in Python, providing an accessible and flexible tool for
proteome-wide thermal profiling studies.

Conclusion: 梯度下降在非对称低秩矩阵补全中具有隐式正则化特性，计算成本更低且性能与其他算法相当。

Abstract: This paper investigates the asymmetric low-rank matrix completion problem,
which can be formulated as an unconstrained non-convex optimization problem
with a nonlinear least-squares objective function, and is solved via gradient
descent methods. Previous gradient descent approaches typically incorporate
regularization terms into the objective function to guarantee convergence.
However, numerical experiments and theoretical analysis of the gradient flow
both demonstrate that the elimination of regularization terms in gradient
descent algorithms does not adversely affect convergence performance. By
introducing the leave-one-out technique, we inductively prove that the vanilla
gradient descent with spectral initialization achieves a linear convergence
rate with high probability. Besides, we demonstrate that the balancing
regularization term exhibits a small norm during iterations, which reveals the
implicit regularization property of gradient descent. Empirical results show
that our algorithm has a lower computational cost while maintaining comparable
completion performance compared to other gradient descent algorithms.

Conclusion: DCM机制能有效提升噪声标签下的模型鲁棒性，且KANs在真实噪声场景中表现优于MLPs。

Abstract: Noisy labels are inevitable in real-world scenarios. Due to the strong
capacity of deep neural networks to memorize corrupted labels, these noisy
labels can cause significant performance degradation. Existing research on
mitigating the negative effects of noisy labels has mainly focused on robust
loss functions and sample selection, with comparatively limited exploration of
regularization in model architecture. Inspired by the sparsity regularization
used in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), we propose a Dynamic Connection
Masking (DCM) mechanism for both Multi-Layer Perceptron Networks (MLPs) and
KANs to enhance the robustness of classifiers against noisy labels. The
mechanism can adaptively mask less important edges during training by
evaluating their information-carrying capacity. Through theoretical analysis,
we demonstrate its efficiency in reducing gradient error. Our approach can be
seamlessly integrated into various noise-robust training methods to build more
robust deep networks, including robust loss functions, sample selection
strategies, and regularization techniques. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we are also the
first to investigate KANs as classifiers against noisy labels, revealing their
superior noise robustness over MLPs in real-world noisy scenarios. Our code
will soon be publicly available.

Abstract: Brain connectomes, representing neural connectivity as graphs, are crucial
for understanding brain organization but costly and time-consuming to acquire,
motivating generative approaches. Recent advances in graph generative modeling
offer a data-driven alternative, enabling synthetic connectome generation and
reducing dependence on large neuroimaging datasets. However, current models
face key limitations: (i) compressing the whole graph into a single latent code
(e.g., VGAEs) blurs fine-grained local motifs; (ii) relying on rich node
attributes rarely available in connectomes reduces reconstruction quality;
(iii) edge-centric models emphasize topology but overlook accurate edge-weight
prediction, harming quantitative fidelity; and (iv) computationally expensive
designs (e.g., edge-conditioned convolutions) impose high memory demands,
limiting scalability. We propose GraphTreeGen (GTG), a subtree-centric
generative framework for efficient, accurate connectome synthesis. GTG
decomposes each connectome into entropy-guided k-hop trees capturing
informative local structure, encoded by a shared GCN. A bipartite
message-passing layer fuses subtree embeddings with global node features, while
a dual-branch decoder jointly predicts edge existence and weights to
reconstruct the adjacency matrix. GTG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
self-supervised tasks and remains competitive in supervised settings,
delivering higher structural fidelity and more precise weights with far less
memory. Its modular design enables extensions to connectome super-resolution
and cross-modality synthesis. Code: https://github.com/basiralab/GTG/

### [262] [Improving ARDS Diagnosis Through Context-Aware Concept Bottleneck Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09719)
*Anish Narain,Ritam Majumdar,Nikita Narayanan,Dominic Marshall,Sonali Parbhoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLM）处理临床笔记以改进概念瓶颈模型（CBM）性能的方法，显著提升了急性呼吸窘迫综合征（ARDS）识别的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型临床数据集虽为疾病异质性和个性化治疗提供了资源，但数据不完整且缺乏标签，现有AI工具的可解释性有限。概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）虽能提供可解释的概念，但在任务解释不足时性能受限。

Method: 通过大型语言模型（LLM）处理临床笔记，生成额外概念以补充CBM，提升模型性能。

Result: 该方法在ARDS识别任务中实现了10%的性能提升，并生成了更全面的概念，减少了信息泄漏和虚假依赖。

Conclusion: 结合临床笔记的上下文信息能显著提升CBM的性能和可解释性，为复杂疾病的识别提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large, publicly available clinical datasets have emerged as a novel resource
for understanding disease heterogeneity and to explore personalization of
therapy. These datasets are derived from data not originally collected for
research purposes and, as a result, are often incomplete and lack critical
labels. Many AI tools have been developed to retrospectively label these
datasets, such as by performing disease classification; however, they often
suffer from limited interpretability. Previous work has attempted to explain
predictions using Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which learn interpretable
concepts that map to higher-level clinical ideas, facilitating human
evaluation. However, these models often experience performance limitations when
the concepts fail to adequately explain or characterize the task. We use the
identification of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) as a challenging
test case to demonstrate the value of incorporating contextual information from
clinical notes to improve CBM performance. Our approach leverages a Large
Language Model (LLM) to process clinical notes and generate additional
concepts, resulting in a 10% performance gain over existing methods.
Additionally, it facilitates the learning of more comprehensive concepts,
thereby reducing the risk of information leakage and reliance on spurious
shortcuts, thus improving the characterization of ARDS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出GenCO框架，结合生成模型与多实例奖励学习，优化电商广告创意组合选择，显著提升广告收入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法单独评估创意元素，无法高效探索庞大的组合空间，导致广告效果不佳。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：1) 生成模型生成多样化创意组合；2) 多实例学习模型将组合级反馈（如点击）归因于单个元素，优化生成过程。

Result: 在电商平台部署后，广告收入显著提升，并发布了工业级数据集。

Conclusion: GenCO框架有效解决了创意组合优化问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In e-commerce advertising, selecting the most compelling combination of
creative elements -- such as titles, images, and highlights -- is critical for
capturing user attention and driving conversions. However, existing methods
often evaluate creative components individually, failing to navigate the
exponentially large search space of possible combinations. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel framework named GenCO that integrates generative
modeling with multi-instance reward learning. Our unified two-stage
architecture first employs a generative model to efficiently produce a diverse
set of creative combinations. This generative process is optimized with
reinforcement learning, enabling the model to effectively explore and refine
its selections. Next, to overcome the challenge of sparse user feedback, a
multi-instance learning model attributes combination-level rewards, such as
clicks, to the individual creative elements. This allows the reward model to
provide a more accurate feedback signal, which in turn guides the generative
model toward creating more effective combinations. Deployed on a leading
e-commerce platform, our approach has significantly increased advertising
revenue, demonstrating its practical value. Additionally, we are releasing a
large-scale industrial dataset to facilitate further research in this important
domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Hereditary Knowledge Transfer (HKT) 的生物启发框架，通过模块化和选择性特征转移优化小型可部署模型，显著提升性能并保持紧凑性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前神经网络研究趋势表明，模型性能通常通过增加深度和容量提升，但这会牺牲可集成性和效率。本文旨在解决这一问题，提出一种优化小型模型的方法。

Method: HKT框架受生物遗传机制启发，通过提取、转移和混合（ETM）三阶段过程实现特征转移，并引入遗传注意力（GA）机制确保选择性集成。

Result: 在多种视觉任务（如光流、图像分类、语义分割）中，HKT显著优于传统蒸馏方法，同时保持模型的紧凑性。

Conclusion: HKT为资源受限环境提供了一种通用、可解释且可扩展的高性能神经网络部署方案。

Abstract: A prevailing trend in neural network research suggests that model performance
improves with increasing depth and capacity - often at the cost of
integrability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a strategy to optimize
small, deployable models by enhancing their capabilities through structured
knowledge inheritance. We introduce Hereditary Knowledge Transfer (HKT), a
biologically inspired framework for modular and selective transfer of
task-relevant features from a larger, pretrained parent network to a smaller
child model. Unlike standard knowledge distillation, which enforces uniform
imitation of teacher outputs, HKT draws inspiration from biological inheritance
mechanisms - such as memory RNA transfer in planarians - to guide a multi-stage
process of feature transfer. Neural network blocks are treated as functional
carriers, and knowledge is transmitted through three biologically motivated
components: Extraction, Transfer, and Mixture (ETM). A novel Genetic Attention
(GA) mechanism governs the integration of inherited and native representations,
ensuring both alignment and selectivity. We evaluate HKT across diverse vision
tasks, including optical flow (Sintel, KITTI), image classification (CIFAR-10),
and semantic segmentation (LiTS), demonstrating that it significantly improves
child model performance while preserving its compactness. The results show that
HKT consistently outperforms conventional distillation approaches, offering a
general-purpose, interpretable, and scalable solution for deploying
high-performance neural networks in resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文开发了一种机器学习模型，通过捕捉生物标志物的动态变化来预测个体衰老轨迹，显著优于传统静态模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测个体衰老轨迹是预防医学和生物信息学的核心挑战，现有模型常忽略衰老的动态性。

Method: 利用纵向队列数据，设计捕捉生物标志物变化率的新特征，构建LightGBM模型。

Result: 模型在预测未来时间点的年龄时表现优异（男性R²=0.515，女性R²=0.498），动态特征重要性高。

Conclusion: 动态健康轨迹是生物年龄的关键决定因素，该框架为临床工具开发提供了新方向。

Abstract: Predicting an individual's aging trajectory is a central challenge in
preventative medicine and bioinformatics. While machine learning models can
predict chronological age from biomarkers, they often fail to capture the
dynamic, longitudinal nature of the aging process. In this work, we developed
and validated a machine learning pipeline to predict age using a longitudinal
cohort with data from two distinct time periods (2019-2020 and 2021-2022). We
demonstrate that a model using only static, cross-sectional biomarkers has
limited predictive power when generalizing to future time points. However, by
engineering novel features that explicitly capture the rate of change (slope)
of key biomarkers over time, we significantly improved model performance. Our
final LightGBM model, trained on the initial wave of data, successfully
predicted age in the subsequent wave with high accuracy ($R^2 = 0.515$ for
males, $R^2 = 0.498$ for females), significantly outperforming both traditional
linear models and other tree-based ensembles. SHAP analysis of our successful
model revealed that the engineered slope features were among the most important
predictors, highlighting that an individual's health trajectory, not just their
static health snapshot, is a key determinant of biological age. Our framework
paves the way for clinical tools that dynamically track patient health
trajectories, enabling early intervention and personalized prevention
strategies for age-related diseases.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a growing interest and adoption of LLMs, with
$\mu$Transfer becoming a key technique for tuning hyperparameters in
large-scale training. Meanwhile, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a
leading architecture in extremely large models. However, the intersection of
these two advancements has remained unexplored. In this work, we derive a
$\mu$-Parameterization ($\mu$P) for MoE, providing theoretical guarantees for
feature learning across model widths in both the router and experts. We
empirically validate our parameterization and further investigate how scaling
the number of experts and granularity affects the optimal learning rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能电网和电表的普及提供了更精细的负荷数据，但多区域负荷预测面临区域、上下文和时间变化的挑战。

Method: 提出TriForecaster框架，包含RegionMixer和CTSpecializer层，动态协调专家模型在区域、上下文和时间维度的合作。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上，TriForecaster平均预测误差降低22.4%，并在中国东部17个城市成功部署。

Conclusion: TriForecaster在多区域电力负荷预测中表现出灵活性和广泛适用性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Electric load forecasting is pivotal for power system operation, planning and
decision-making. The rise of smart grids and meters has provided more detailed
and high-quality load data at multiple levels of granularity, from home to bus
and cities. Motivated by similar patterns of loads across different cities in a
province in eastern China, in this paper we focus on the Multi-Region Electric
Load Forecasting (MRELF) problem, targeting accurate short-term load
forecasting for multiple sub-regions within a large region. We identify three
challenges for MRELF, including regional variation, contextual variation, and
temporal variation. To address them, we propose TriForecaster, a new framework
leveraging the Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach within a Multi-Task Learning
(MTL) paradigm to overcome these challenges. TriForecaster features RegionMixer
and Context-Time Specializer (CTSpecializer) layers, enabling dynamic
cooperation and specialization of expert models across regional, contextual,
and temporal dimensions. Based on evaluation on four real-world MRELF datasets
with varied granularity, TriForecaster outperforms state-of-the-art models by
achieving an average forecast error reduction of 22.4\%, thereby demonstrating
its flexibility and broad applicability. In particular, the deployment of
TriForecaster on the eForecaster platform in eastern China exemplifies its
practical utility, effectively providing city-level, short-term load forecasts
for 17 cities, supporting a population exceeding 110 million and daily
electricity usage over 100 gigawatt-hours.

Motivation: 旨在通过减少权重空间的自由度，将训练重点转移到数据和激活空间，以提高训练效率和模型性能。

Method: 采用闭式权重计算和梯度优化（Adam）更新原型，通过岭正则化伪逆求解权重矩阵，同时优化隐藏激活。

Result: 在MNIST和Fashion-MNIST数据集上分别达到97.8%和89.3%的测试准确率，训练时间仅需3.9-4.5秒。

Conclusion: 该方法在准确性、速度和模型大小之间取得了优越的平衡，优于传统方法如ELM和反向传播训练的浅层MLP。

Abstract: We present Proto-PINV+H, a fast training paradigm that combines closed-form
weight computation with gradient-based optimisation of a small set of synthetic
inputs, soft labels, and-crucially-hidden activations. At each iteration we
recompute all weight matrices in closed form via two (or more)
ridge-regularised pseudo-inverse solves, while updating only the prototypes
with Adam. The trainable degrees of freedom are thus shifted from weight space
to data/activation space. On MNIST (60k train, 10k test) and Fashion-MNIST (60k
train, 10k test), our method reaches 97.8% and 89.3% test accuracy on the
official 10k test sets, respectively, in 3.9s--4.5s using approximately 130k
trainable parameters and only 250 epochs on an RTX 5060 (16GB). We provide a
multi-layer extension (optimised activations at each hidden stage), learnable
ridge parameters, optional PCA/PLS projections, and theory linking the
condition number of prototype matrices to generalisation. The approach yields
favourable accuracy--speed--size trade-offs against ELM, random-feature ridge,
and shallow MLPs trained by back-propagation.

Abstract: Biomechanical features have become important indicators for evaluating
athletes' techniques. Traditionally, experts propose significant features and
evaluate them using physics equations. However, the complexity of the human
body and its movements makes it challenging to explicitly analyze the
relationships between some features and athletes' final performance. With
advancements in modern machine learning and statistics, data analytics methods
have gained increasing importance in sports analytics. In this study, we
leverage machine learning models to analyze expert-proposed biomechanical
features from the finals of long jump competitions in the World Championships.
The objectives of the analysis include identifying the most important features
contributing to top-performing jumps and exploring the combined effects of
these key features. Using quantile regression, we model the relationship
between the biomechanical feature set and the target variable (effective
distance), with a particular focus on elite-level jumps. To interpret the
model, we apply SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) alongside Partial
Dependence Plots (PDPs) and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots. The
findings reveal that, beyond the well-documented velocity-related features,
specific technical aspects also play a pivotal role. For male athletes, the
angle of the knee of the supporting leg before take-off is identified as a key
factor for achieving top 10% performance in our dataset, with angles greater
than 169{\deg}contributing significantly to jump performance. In contrast, for
female athletes, the landing pose and approach step technique emerge as the
most critical features influencing top 10% performances, alongside velocity.
This study establishes a framework for analyzing the impact of various features
on athletic performance, with a particular emphasis on top-performing events.

Conclusion: 理论框架揭示了变换器优于静态嵌入模型的优势，并通过实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has garnered significant attention for its ability
to grasp functions/tasks from demonstrations. Recent studies suggest the
presence of a latent task/function vector in LLMs during ICL. Merullo et al.
(2024) showed that LLMs leverage this vector alongside the residual stream for
Word2Vec-like vector arithmetic, solving factual-recall ICL tasks.
Additionally, recent work empirically highlighted the key role of
Question-Answer data in enhancing factual-recall capabilities. Despite these
insights, a theoretical explanation remains elusive. To move one step forward,
we propose a theoretical framework building on empirically grounded
hierarchical concept modeling. We develop an optimization theory, showing how
nonlinear residual transformers trained via gradient descent on cross-entropy
loss perform factual-recall ICL tasks via vector arithmetic. We prove 0-1 loss
convergence and show the strong generalization, including robustness to concept
recombination and distribution shifts. These results elucidate the advantages
of transformers over static embedding predecessors. Empirical simulations
corroborate our theoretical insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有成对偏好学习框架（如RankNet）局限于局部比较，难以捕捉全局排序一致性，因此需要一种更强大的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出RankList框架，通过概率建模局部和非局部排序约束，引入log-sum-exp近似提高训练效率，并扩展了跳步比较以增强全局排序能力。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（如MSP-Podcast、IEMOCAP、BIIC Podcast和Artistic Image Aesthetics）上，RankList在Kendall's Tau和排序准确性上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RankList为主观学习任务提供了一种统一且可扩展的偏好建模方法，具有广泛的适用性和优越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Preference learning has gained significant attention in tasks involving
subjective human judgments, such as \emph{speech emotion recognition} (SER) and
image aesthetic assessment. While pairwise frameworks such as RankNet offer
robust modeling of relative preferences, they are inherently limited to local
comparisons and struggle to capture global ranking consistency. To address
these limitations, we propose RankList, a novel listwise preference learning
framework that generalizes RankNet to structured list-level supervision. Our
formulation explicitly models local and non-local ranking constraints within a
probabilistic framework. The paper introduces a log-sum-exp approximation to
improve training efficiency. We further extend RankList with skip-wise
comparisons, enabling progressive exposure to complex list structures and
enhancing global ranking fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method across diverse modalities. On benchmark SER datasets
(MSP-Podcast, IEMOCAP, BIIC Podcast), RankList achieves consistent improvements
in Kendall's Tau and ranking accuracy compared to standard listwise baselines.
We also validate our approach on aesthetic image ranking using the Artistic
Image Aesthetics dataset, highlighting its broad applicability. Through
ablation and cross-domain studies, we show that RankList not only improves
in-domain ranking but also generalizes better across datasets. Our framework
offers a unified, extensible approach for modeling ordered preferences in
subjective learning scenarios.

Motivation: 当前联邦学习遗忘研究主要关注效率和有效性，而效率和性能公平性在去中心化客户端中的重要性尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出FedShard算法，自适应解决收敛、遗忘效率和公平性之间的挑战，并引入两种新指标量化评估公平性。

Result: FedShard在遗忘性能和效率上均表现出公平性，实验显示其遗忘速度比从头训练快1.3-6.2倍，比现有最优方法快4.9倍。

Conclusion: FedShard有效缓解了不公平风险（如级联离开和投毒攻击），并在客户端间实现了更平衡的遗忘成本。

Abstract: To protect clients' right to be forgotten in federated learning, federated
unlearning aims to remove the data contribution of leaving clients from the
global learned model. While current studies mainly focused on enhancing
unlearning efficiency and effectiveness, the crucial aspects of efficiency
fairness and performance fairness among decentralized clients during unlearning
have remained largely unexplored. In this study, we introduce FedShard, the
first federated unlearning algorithm designed to concurrently guarantee both
efficiency fairness and performance fairness. FedShard adaptively addresses the
challenges introduced by dilemmas among convergence, unlearning efficiency, and
unlearning fairness. Furthermore, we propose two novel metrics to
quantitatively assess the fairness of unlearning algorithms, which we prove to
satisfy well-known properties in other existing fairness measurements. Our
theoretical analysis and numerical evaluation validate FedShard's fairness in
terms of both unlearning performance and efficiency. We demonstrate that
FedShard mitigates unfairness risks such as cascaded leaving and poisoning
attacks and realizes more balanced unlearning costs among clients. Experimental
results indicate that FedShard accelerates the data unlearning process 1.3-6.2
times faster than retraining from scratch and 4.9 times faster than the
state-of-the-art exact unlearning methods.

Conclusion: DED提供了一种高效且实用的方法，能够在减少计算资源的同时提升推理能力，并保持模型的通用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities in
tasks such as algorithmic coding and mathematical problem-solving. Recent
methods have improved reasoning through expanded corpus and multistage training
combining reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. Although some
methods suggest that small but targeted dataset can incentivize reasoning via
only distillation, a reasoning scaling laws is still taking shape, increasing
computational costs. To address this, we propose a data-efficient distillation
framework (DED) that optimizes the Pareto frontier of reasoning distillation.
Inspired by the on-policy learning and diverse roll-out strategies of
reinforcement learning, the key idea of our approach is threefold: (1) We
identify that benchmark scores alone do not determine an effective teacher
model. Through comprehensive comparisons of leading reasoning LLMs, we develop
a method to select an optimal teacher model. (2) While scaling distillation can
enhance reasoning, it often degrades out-of-domain performance. A carefully
curated, smaller corpus achieves a balanced trade-off between in-domain and
out-of-domain capabilities. (3) Diverse reasoning trajectories encourage the
student model to develop robust reasoning skills. We validate our method
through evaluations on mathematical reasoning (AIME 2024/2025, MATH-500) and
code generation (LiveCodeBench), achieving state-of-the-art results with only
0.8k carefully curated examples, bypassing the need for extensive scaling. Our
systematic analysis demonstrates that DED outperforms existing methods by
considering factors beyond superficial hardness, token length, or teacher model
capability. This work offers a practical and efficient pathway to advanced

Abstract: In the field of pedometrics, tabular machine learning is the predominant
method for predicting soil properties from remote and proximal soil sensing
data, forming a central component of digital soil mapping. At the field-scale,
this predictive soil modeling (PSM) task is typically constrained by small
training sample sizes and high feature-to-sample ratios in soil spectroscopy.
Traditionally, these conditions have proven challenging for conventional deep
learning methods. Classical machine learning algorithms, particularly
tree-based models like Random Forest and linear models such as Partial Least
Squares Regression, have long been the default choice for field-scale PSM.
Recent advances in artificial neural networks (ANN) for tabular data challenge
this view, yet their suitability for field-scale PSM has not been proven. We
introduce a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates state-of-the-art ANN
architectures, including the latest multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based models
(TabM, RealMLP), attention-based transformer variants (FT-Transformer,
ExcelFormer, T2G-Former, AMFormer), retrieval-augmented approaches (TabR,
ModernNCA), and an in-context learning foundation model (TabPFN). Our
evaluation encompasses 31 field- and farm-scale datasets containing 30 to 460
samples and three critical soil properties: soil organic matter or soil organic
carbon, pH, and clay content. Our results reveal that modern ANNs consistently
outperform classical methods on the majority of tasks, demonstrating that deep
learning has matured sufficiently to overcome the long-standing dominance of
classical machine learning for PSM. Notably, TabPFN delivers the strongest
overall performance, showing robustness across varying conditions. We therefore
recommend the adoption of modern ANNs for field-scale PSM and propose TabPFN as
the new default choice in the toolkit of every pedometrician.

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何确定数据集中是否存在异常，提出了一个基于数据集大小、污染率和算法常数的下限条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常检测中确认异常存在的研究较少，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过超过三百万次统计测试，分析不同异常检测任务和算法，发现数据集大小、污染率和算法常数之间的关系。

Result: 提出了一个下限条件 $N \ge \frac{\alpha_{\text{algo}}}{\nu^2}$，用于确认异常存在。

Conclusion: 该条件揭示了异常稀有性对确认其存在的限制。

Abstract: Detecting whether any anomalies exist within a dataset is crucial for
effective anomaly detection, yet it remains surprisingly underexplored in
anomaly detection literature. This paper presents a comprehensive study that
addresses the fundamental question: When can we conclusively determine that
anomalies are present? Through extensive experimentation involving over three
million statistical tests across various anomaly detection tasks and
algorithms, we identify a relationship between the dataset size, contamination
rate, and an algorithm-dependent constant $ \alpha_{\text{algo}} $. Our results
demonstrate that, for an unlabeled dataset of size $ N $ and contamination rate
$ \nu $, the condition $ N \ge \frac{\alpha_{\text{algo}}}{\nu^2} $ represents
a lower bound on the number of samples required to confirm anomaly existence.
This threshold implies a limit to how rare anomalies can be before proving
their existence becomes infeasible.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅通过直接提示利用LLM进行上下文辅助预测，未能充分发挥其潜力，需进一步探索。

Method: 提出四种策略：ReDP（显式推理跟踪）、CorDP（上下文修正预测）、IC-DP（嵌入历史示例）、RouteDP（任务难度路由）。

Result: 在CiK基准测试中，这些策略在不同规模和类型的LLM上均优于直接提示方法。

Conclusion: 这些简单而有效的策略为LLM在上下文辅助预测中的应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Forecasting in real-world settings requires models to integrate not only
historical data but also relevant contextual information, often available in
textual form. While recent work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can
be effective context-aided forecasters via na\"ive direct prompting, their full
potential remains underexplored. We address this gap with 4 strategies,
providing new insights into the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in this setting.
ReDP improves interpretability by eliciting explicit reasoning traces, allowing
us to assess the model's reasoning over the context independently from its
forecast accuracy. CorDP leverages LLMs solely to refine existing forecasts
with context, enhancing their applicability in real-world forecasting
pipelines. IC-DP proposes embedding historical examples of context-aided
forecasting tasks in the prompt, substantially improving accuracy even for the
largest models. Finally, RouteDP optimizes resource efficiency by using LLMs to
estimate task difficulty, and routing the most challenging tasks to larger
models. Evaluated on different kinds of context-aided forecasting tasks from
the CiK benchmark, our strategies demonstrate distinct benefits over na\"ive
prompting across LLMs of different sizes and families. These results open the
door to further simple yet effective improvements in LLM-based context-aided
forecasting.

Motivation: 扩散模型在高质量图像生成中表现出色，但计算成本高，尤其是迭代去噪过程。现有方法如潜在空间模型和检索增强扩散模型虽能缓解部分问题，但存在存储成本高、依赖静态模型和缺乏适应性的缺点。

Method: PDM通过对比学习从干净图像特征中构建动态紧凑视觉原型，直接指导去噪步骤，避免了外部存储和检索的需求。

Result: 实验表明，PDM在保持高质量生成的同时，显著降低了计算和存储开销。

Conclusion: PDM为扩散模型中的条件生成提供了一种可扩展的替代方案，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a leading framework for high-quality image
generation, offering stable training and strong performance across diverse
domains. However, they remain computationally intensive, particularly during
the iterative denoising process. Latent-space models like Stable Diffusion
alleviate some of this cost by operating in compressed representations, though
at the expense of fine-grained detail. More recent approaches such as
Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion Models (RDM) address efficiency by conditioning
denoising on similar examples retrieved from large external memory banks. While
effective, these methods introduce drawbacks: they require costly storage and
retrieval infrastructure, depend on static vision-language models like CLIP for
similarity, and lack adaptability during training. We propose the Prototype
Diffusion Model (PDM), a method that integrates prototype learning directly
into the diffusion process for efficient and adaptive visual conditioning -
without external memory. Instead of retrieving reference samples, PDM
constructs a dynamic set of compact visual prototypes from clean image features
using contrastive learning. These prototypes guide the denoising steps by
aligning noisy representations with semantically relevant visual patterns,
enabling efficient generation with strong semantic grounding. Experiments show
that PDM maintains high generation quality while reducing computational and
storage overhead, offering a scalable alternative to retrieval-based
conditioning in diffusion models.

Abstract: We introduce a novel class of untrained Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
within the Reservoir Computing (RC) paradigm, called Residual Reservoir Memory
Networks (ResRMNs). ResRMN combines a linear memory reservoir with a non-linear
reservoir, where the latter is based on residual orthogonal connections along
the temporal dimension for enhanced long-term propagation of the input. The
resulting reservoir state dynamics are studied through the lens of linear
stability analysis, and we investigate diverse configurations for the temporal
residual connections. The proposed approach is empirically assessed on
time-series and pixel-level 1-D classification tasks. Our experimental results
highlight the advantages of the proposed approach over other conventional RC
models.

Abstract: The new paradigm of test-time scaling has yielded remarkable breakthroughs in
Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g. reasoning models) and in generative vision
models, allowing models to allocate additional computation during inference to
effectively tackle increasingly complex problems. Despite the improvements of
this approach, an important limitation emerges: the substantial increase in
computation time makes the process slow and impractical for many applications.
Given the success of this paradigm and its growing usage, we seek to preserve
its benefits while eschewing the inference overhead. In this work we propose
one solution to the critical problem of integrating test-time scaling knowledge
into a model during post-training. Specifically, we replace reward guided
test-time noise optimization in diffusion models with a Noise Hypernetwork that
modulates initial input noise. We propose a theoretically grounded framework
for learning this reward-tilted distribution for distilled generators, through
a tractable noise-space objective that maintains fidelity to the base model
while optimizing for desired characteristics. We show that our approach
recovers a substantial portion of the quality gains from explicit test-time
optimization at a fraction of the computational cost. Code is available at

Abstract: Graph incremental learning is a learning paradigm that aims to adapt trained
models to continuously incremented graphs and data over time without the need
for retraining on the full dataset. However, regular graph machine learning
methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting when applied to incremental
learning settings, where previously learned knowledge is overridden by new
knowledge. Previous approaches have tried to address this by treating the
previously trained model as an inseparable unit and using techniques to
maintain old behaviors while learning new knowledge. These approaches, however,
do not account for the fact that previously acquired knowledge at different
timestamps contributes differently to learning new tasks. Some prior patterns
can be transferred to help learn new data, while others may deviate from the
new data distribution and be detrimental. To address this, we propose a dynamic
mixture-of-experts (DyMoE) approach for incremental learning. Specifically, a
DyMoE GNN layer adds new expert networks specialized in modeling the incoming
data blocks. We design a customized regularization loss that utilizes data
sequence information so existing experts can maintain their ability to solve
old tasks while helping the new expert learn the new data effectively. As the
number of data blocks grows over time, the computational cost of the full
mixture-of-experts (MoE) model increases. To address this, we introduce a
sparse MoE approach, where only the top-$k$ most relevant experts make
predictions, significantly reducing the computation time. Our model achieved
4.92\% relative accuracy increase compared to the best baselines on class
incremental learning, showing the model's exceptional power.
