TL;DR: CHAIR-DPO方法利用CHAIR指标构建偏好数据，通过直接偏好优化(DPO)减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题，无需复杂合成流程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)在多种任务中表现出色，但存在严重的幻觉问题，即生成与视觉输入不符的答案，需要解决这一对齐问题

Method: 利用CHAIR指标自动区分幻觉和非幻觉样本对，构建偏好数据，然后使用直接偏好优化(DPO)对现成MLLMs进行微调

Result: CHAIR-DPO方法在多个幻觉基准测试中有效减少了幻觉答案的数量，证明了基于CHAIR奖励微调的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，无需依赖复杂合成流程或专有模型，即可显著降低MLLMs的幻觉问题

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

### [2] [SDiFL: Stable Diffusion-Driven Framework for Image Forgery Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20182)
*Yang Su,Shunquan Tan,Jiwu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Stable Diffusion V3的多模态图像伪造定位框架，通过将伪造残差作为显式模态融入潜在空间，实现了无需大量标注数据的高效伪造检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像伪造定位方法严重依赖人工标注数据，难以跟上以Stable Diffusion为代表的新一代多模态大模型带来的图像篡改技术进步。

Method: 利用SD3的多模态架构，将图像伪造残差（通过高通滤波器提取的高频信号）作为显式模态融入潜在空间训练，同时保留SD3提取的丰富语义信息。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准数据集上比当前最先进方法性能提升高达12%，在训练中未见过的真实文档伪造和自然场景伪造图像上也表现出强大性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将SD的图像生成和强大感知能力整合到取证框架中，为应对新兴图像篡改技术提供了更高效准确的伪造定位解决方案。

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

TL;DR: 探索多模态大语言模型与定量属性相结合的方法，通过微调使模型能够从图像预测皮肤病变属性值，以提升AI皮肤疾病诊断模型的可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型在皮肤疾病诊断方面表现出色，但模型预测的可解释性仍需大幅提升才能在实际临床中使用。需要找到提高模型解释性的有效方法

Method: 结合多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)和定量属性使用。通过微调使MLLM嵌入空间能够从图像预测病变属性值，并使用SLICE-3D数据集进行基于内容的图像检索案例研究

Result: 研究发现MLLM嵌入空间可以通过微调来预测皮肤病变的定量属性值，证明这种概念基础的预测方法具有改进可解释性的潜力

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型与定量属性相结合的方法为提升AI皮肤疾病诊断模型的可解释性提供了有前景的途径，使模型预测能够基于可解释的概念进行推理

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

### [4] [Enhancing Automatic Modulation Recognition With a Reconstruction-Driven Vision Transformer Under Limited Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20193)
*Hossein Ahmadi,Banafsheh Saffari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的ViT框架，结合监督、自监督和重构目标，用于自动调制识别，在低标签数据情况下显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动调制识别解决方案依赖大量标注数据或多阶段训练流程，限制了实际应用中的可扩展性和泛化能力

Method: 使用ViT编码器、轻量级卷积解码器和线性分类器的统一框架，通过重构分支将增强信号映射回原始信号，在预训练中学习鲁棒特征，在微调中使用部分标签监督

Result: 在RML2018.01A数据集上，低标签情况下优于监督CNN和ViT基线，仅用15-20%标注数据即可达到ResNet水平精度，在不同SNR级别下保持强劲性能

Conclusion: 该框架为自动调制识别提供了简单、可泛化且标签高效的解决方案

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

### [5] [InfinityHuman: Towards Long-Term Audio-Driven Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20210)
*Xiaodi Li,Pan Xie,Yi Ren,Qijun Gan,Chen Zhang,Fangyuan Kong,Xiang Yin,Bingyue Peng,Zehuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfinityHuman是一个从粗到精的音频驱动人体动画框架，通过姿态引导的细化器和手部特定奖励机制，生成高分辨率、长时长的视频，解决了身份漂移、颜色偏移和手部运动失真等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频驱动人体动画方法在生成高分辨率、长时长视频时存在身份漂移、颜色偏移、场景不稳定和手部运动建模不佳的问题，需要解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出coarse-to-fine框架：首先生成音频同步表示，然后使用姿态引导细化器逐步细化为高分辨率视频；利用解耦的姿态序列和初始帧作为视觉锚点减少漂移；引入基于高质量手部运动数据训练的手部特定奖励机制。

Result: 在EMTD和HDTF数据集上的实验表明，InfinityHuman在视频质量、身份保持、手部准确性和唇部同步方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: InfinityHuman通过姿态引导细化器和手部奖励机制有效解决了长视频生成中的漂移和手部失真问题，消融研究证实了各模块的有效性。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

### [6] [Spherical Vision Transformers for Audio-Visual Saliency Prediction in 360-Degree Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20221)
*Mert Cokelek,Halit Ozsoy,Nevrez Imamoglu,Cagri Ozcinar,Inci Ayhan,Erkut Erdem,Aykut Erdem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了两个新颖的360度视频显著性预测模型SalViT360和SalViT360-AV，并创建了YT360-EyeTracking数据集，通过整合空间音频线索显著提升了全景视频中的视觉注意力预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对360度环境中球形畸变和空间音频整合的复杂性，以及缺乏全面的360度视听显著性预测数据集的问题，研究旨在探索如何利用视听线索有效预测360度视频中的视觉显著性。

Method: 创建了包含81个ODV的YT360-EyeTracking数据集，提出了基于视觉变换器的SalViT360框架（具有球形几何感知的时空注意力层）和SalViT360-AV模型（进一步整合了基于音频输入的变换器适配器）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（包括YT360-EyeTracking）上的结果表明，SalViT360和SalViT360-AV在预测360度场景中观看者注意力方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，在模型架构中整合空间音频线索对于准确预测全景视频中的显著性至关重要。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at
https://cyberiada.github.io/SalViT360.

### [7] [A Novel Framework for Automated Explain Vision Model Using Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20227)
*Phu-Vinh Nguyen,Tan-Hanh Pham,Chris Ngo,Truong Son Hy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用视觉语言模型来解释视觉模型行为的pipeline，能够在样本级和数据集级提供解释，帮助发现失败案例和模型趋势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型开发主要关注性能指标如准确率、IoU和mAP，而可解释性方面关注较少。现有xAI方法多为样本级解释，缺乏对模型在大型数据集上整体行为的解释方法

Method: 应用视觉语言模型构建pipeline，提供样本级和数据集级的视觉模型解释，能够以最小工作量发现失败案例和获得模型洞察

Result: 提出的pipeline能够有效解释视觉模型行为，整合视觉模型开发与xAI分析，推进图像分析发展

Conclusion: 该方法为视觉模型提供了全面的可解释性解决方案，有助于防止偏见判断并识别模型趋势模式，对视觉模型开发具有重要意义

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为资源受限的农业环境开发轻量级CNN模型，解决传统知识蒸馏方法在农业计算机视觉应用中的局限性

Method: 使用自适应温度调度和混合样本增强的知识蒸馏框架，从MobileNetV3 Large教师模型向三种不同规模的残差CNN学生模型（1.3M、2.4M、3.8M参数）传递知识

Result: 所有学生模型验证准确率超过96.7%，紧凑模型达到97.11%准确率，比第二好方法提升1.60个百分点，推理延迟仅72.19ms，知识保留率超过99%

Conclusion: ATMS-KD框架在农业计算机视觉任务中表现出色，能够有效传递知识并保持低延迟，适用于资源受限的农业环境

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge
Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable
for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa
damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,
southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact
model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach
while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective
knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

### [9] [Linking heterogeneous microstructure informatics with expert characterization knowledge through customized and hybrid vision-language representations for industrial qualification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20243)
*Mutahar Safdar,Gentry Wood,Max Zimmermann,Guy Lamouche,Priti Wanjara,Yaoyao Fiona Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合视觉语言表示和专家知识的微结构质量评估框架，能够在零样本条件下对未见过的材料微结构进行分类和合格性判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业制造中先进材料的快速可靠质量评估存在瓶颈，特别是对于非传统增材制造产生的异质结构材料，需要将微观结构信息与专家知识有效结合。

Method: 开发定制化的混合视觉语言表示(VLRs)，整合深度语义分割与预训练多模态模型(CLIP和FLAVA)，通过相似性评分方法实现零样本分类，并使用Z-score归一化调整相似度分数。

Result: 在增材制造金属基复合材料数据集上验证，框架能够有效区分合格与缺陷样品，FLAVA模型具有更高的视觉敏感性，CLIP模型与文本标准对齐更一致。

Conclusion: 该方法通过促进原始数据与专家知识的语义互操作性，为工程信息学提供了可扩展和领域自适应的质量评估策略，增强了质量评估流程的可追溯性和可解释性。

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck
in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced
via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a
novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert
characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究开发了基于MedNeXt-L-k5的自动化血管周围间隙分割方法，在T2加权MRI上达到与人工标注相当的0.88 Dice分数，但在T1加权MRI上性能较差，且未能超越nnU-Net模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 血管周围间隙扩大是多种脑部疾病的生物标志物，但手动分割耗时且可靠性有限，现有深度学习模型性能中等且泛化能力不足。

Method: 采用Transformer启发的3D编码器-解码器卷积网络MedNeXt-L-k5，分别在均质T2加权MRI数据集和异质T1加权MRI数据集上进行训练，使用5折交叉验证和留一站点交叉验证评估性能。

Result: 在T2加权图像上达到0.88±0.06的Dice分数（白质），与人工标注可靠性相当；在T1加权图像上性能显著降低（0.58±0.09）；跨站点验证表现中等。

Conclusion: MedNeXt-L-k5为不同MRI数据集提供了有效的PVS分割解决方案，但Transformer的注意力机制对PVS分割并非必需，因为未能超越nnU-Net的性能。

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

### [11] [Plug-in Feedback Self-adaptive Attention in CLIP for Training-free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20265)
*Zhixiang Chi,Yanan Wu,Li Gu,Huan Liu,Ziqiang Wang,Yang Zhang,Yang Wang,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练、基于反馈的自适应框架，通过将输出级别的补丁对应关系反馈到中间注意力机制中，增强CLIP在开放词汇分割中的空间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在视觉-文本对齐方面表现强劲，但在开放词汇分割中由于定位能力差而表现不佳。先前的方法通过修改中间注意力来增强空间一致性，但由于后续操作（如投影）导致这种一致性无法持续传播到最终输出，且中间注意力缺乏与文本表示的直接交互。

Method: 设计了一个训练免费、反馈驱动的自适应性框架，将基于输出的补丁级对应关系反馈到中间注意力中。包括注意力隔离、基于置信度的稀疏适应剪枝和适应集成等关键模块，有效反馈输出一致性线索。

Result: 该方法作为即插即用模块，无缝集成到四种最先进方法中，使用三种骨干网络（ViT-B、ViT-L、ViT-H），并在多种注意力类型上验证。在八个基准测试中 consistently 提升性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用模型输出作为更强的空间一致性先验，提出的框架有效增强了内部表示与最终预测之间的语义一致性，显著提升了开放词汇分割性能。

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,
and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently
improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

*Zhuoran Yu,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个探测框架来系统分析多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)在不同层次处理视觉和文本输入的方式，揭示了模型的分层处理结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在各种视觉语言任务上表现出色，但其内部处理机制仍未被充分探索，需要系统性的分析框架来理解其处理动态。

Method: 训练线性分类器预测从各层token嵌入中提取的细粒度视觉类别，使用标准化锚点问题，并在三种提示变体下评估：词汇变体、语义否定变体和输出格式变体。

Result: 发现在LLaVA-1.5、LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3和Qwen2-VL中存在一致的分层结构：早期层执行视觉基础，中间层支持词汇整合和语义推理，最终层准备任务特定输出。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了对MLLMs层次化组织的统一视角，并提供了一个轻量级、模型无关的方法来分析多模态表示动态。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal

*Zhi Li,Hau Phan,Matthew Emigh,Austin J. Brockmeier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出SLiCS方法，通过监督字典学习将视觉-语言联合嵌入空间解耦为多个概念特定的子空间，实现更精确的概念过滤图像检索和条件生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言联合嵌入空间（如CLIP）包含丰富的语义信息，但缺乏对复杂场景内容的解耦能力。作者假设可以通过分解嵌入向量来分离不同概念的信息。

Method: 采用监督字典学习方法，估计一个线性合成模型，通过稀疏、非负的原子组合来表示多标签信息。使用交替优化算法训练分组结构字典，并利用文本嵌入进行语义描述和零样本分类。

Result: SLiCS方法在CLIP、TiTok和DINOv2等多种嵌入空间上都实现了更精确的概念过滤图像检索，定量和定性结果均显示性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过稀疏线性概念子空间对嵌入空间进行解耦，能够有效提升概念特定的图像检索和生成任务的精度，该方法具有通用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

TL;DR: MedFoundationHub是一个图形界面工具包，旨在解决医疗视觉语言模型(VLMs)的安全隐私问题，支持医生无编程使用模型，工程师快速部署，并通过Docker确保隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗视觉语言模型虽然为临床应用带来机遇，但存在严重的隐私安全风险，包括受保护健康信息泄露、数据泄漏和网络威胁漏洞，特别是在医院环境中尤为关键。

Method: 开发MedFoundationHub图形用户界面工具包，支持手动选择模型、即插即用部署Hugging Face开源模型，通过Docker编排实现操作系统无关的隐私保护推理，仅需单块NVIDIA A6000 GPU的本地工作站。

Result: 邀请认证病理学家部署评估5个先进VLM模型，涵盖结肠和肾脏病例，产生1015次临床医生-模型评分事件，发现存在脱靶回答、模糊推理和病理术语不一致等重复性限制。

Conclusion: MedFoundationHub提供了一个安全、易用的医疗VLM部署解决方案，但当前模型仍存在显著局限性，需要在专业术语准确性和推理质量方面进一步改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,
yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed
recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出双向交互Mamba(BIM)模型，通过双向交互扫描(BI-Scan)和多尺度扫描(MS-Scan)机制，在保持线性计算复杂度的同时实现多任务密集预测中的充分跨任务交互


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多任务密集预测中充分跨任务交互与计算效率之间的权衡问题，现有方法往往需要在交互完整性和计算效率之间做出妥协

Method: 采用Bidirectional Interaction Mamba架构，包含BI-Scan机制（任务优先和位置优先扫描模式）和MS-Scan机制（多粒度场景建模），在统一线性复杂度框架下保持关键跨任务信息

Result: 在NYUD-V2和PASCAL-Context两个挑战性基准测试中展现出优于最先进竞争方法的性能

Conclusion: BIM模型成功解决了多任务密集预测中的交互-效率权衡问题，通过创新的扫描机制实现了高效且充分的跨任务交互

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的音频引导视觉编辑框架，通过预训练多模态编码器和创新的噪声分支技术，无需额外训练即可处理多文本和音频提示的复杂编辑任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型视觉编辑方法在处理复杂场景时，仅靠文本指导往往无法充分描述编辑需求，需要额外的非文本编辑提示来提供更丰富的信息。

Method: 利用预训练多模态编码器的零样本能力，通过减轻音频编码器空间与扩散模型提示编码器空间之间的差异，整合多样化音频到视觉编辑任务中，并提出分离噪声分支和自适应补丁选择来处理多模态编辑提示。

Result: 在多样化编辑任务上的综合实验表明，该框架能够通过整合音频提供的丰富信息，在文本方法失败的复杂编辑场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: 该音频引导视觉编辑框架成功解决了复杂编辑场景中文本指导不足的问题，为多模态视觉编辑提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

Method: 提出广义伪标签鲁棒损失(GPR Loss)从多样化伪标签中有效学习并减轻噪声，结合动态增强多焦点伪标签(DAMP)技术，形成自适应高效视觉语言伪标签(AEVLP)框架

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该框架显著推进了多标签分类，达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: AEVLP框架通过创新的损失函数和伪标签技术，有效解决了单正多标签学习中的噪声和准确性问题

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: 提出了一种延迟脉冲方法和时间依赖的积分发放(tdIF)神经元架构，解决了SNN在视觉检测任务中性能不佳的问题，在超低时间步长(5步内)下实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ANN-SNN转换方法在分类任务中表现优异，但在视觉检测任务中性能仍然不理想，主要存在异质脉冲模式导致的残余膜电位问题。

Method: 采用延迟脉冲方法缓解异质脉冲模式问题，并提出tdIF神经元架构，使IF神经元能够根据时间步长的时序动态调整积累和发放行为。

Result: 在目标检测和车道线检测两个关键视觉任务上进行了广泛评估，证明该方法超越了当前ANN-SNN转换方法，在超低延迟(5个时间步内)下达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法使脉冲能够表现出不同的时间特性，而不仅仅依赖于基于频率的表示，在更少的时间步长下实现了更精确的特征表示，同时保持了与传统IF神经元相当的能量消耗。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

TL;DR: 提出DUP-MCRNet网络，通过动态不确定性传播和多模态协同推理解决显著目标检测中的细节丢失、边缘模糊和多模态信息融合不足问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有显著目标检测方法在复杂场景中容易丢失细节、模糊边缘，且单模态信息融合不足，需要提升检测精度和鲁棒性

Method: 设计动态不确定性图卷积模块(DUGC)传播层间不确定性，提出多模态协同融合策略(MCF)使用可学习模态门控权重融合RGB、深度和边缘特征，通过多尺度损失和一致性约束优化检测性能

Conclusion: DUP-MCRNet通过不确定性传播和多模态协同融合有效提升了显著目标检测的精度和鲁棒性，特别适用于复杂场景

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.

Conclusion: 多尺度BEV特征能够继承多视角对应尺度图像特征特性，有助于精确检测视角内尺度一致的行人，同时特征金字塔网络融合改善了视角间尺度差异巨大的行人检测

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

Conclusion: SFMFNet为实时深度伪造检测提供了有效的轻量级解决方案，适合视频会议和社交媒体等实时应用场景

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature
interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key
semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

Conclusion: 通过结合双模型权重选择和自知识蒸馏，该方法克服了传统方法在紧凑模型中保留关键信息的局限性，为医疗环境中的实际应用提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: 通过集成两个模块生成紧凑特征表示，提供高效上下文建模并加速编码过程，解决了LiDAR点云压缩中的稀疏性挑战

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

Motivation: 3D领域面临数据稀缺问题，相比文本和图像，互联网上的3D数据量有限。视频数据包含丰富的空间一致性和语义信息，可以作为替代的监督信号来缓解3D生成中的泛化瓶颈。

Method: 构建Droplet3D-4M数据集（首个大规模多视角标注视频数据集），训练Droplet3D生成模型，支持图像和密集文本输入，利用视频中的空间一致性先验和语义信息进行3D生成。

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose
G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability

TL;DR: 提出一种病理信息化的域随机化策略，通过从健康数据模拟胼胝体发育不良(CCD)的脑部改变，无需病理标注即可实现鲁棒的胎儿脑部分割，显著提升CCD病例的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胼胝体发育不良(CCD)等罕见病症导致标注数据稀缺，限制了深度学习模型的泛化能力，需要解决病理数据不足的问题。

Method: 采用病理信息化的域随机化策略，将CCD表现的前验知识嵌入合成数据生成流程，仅从健康数据模拟多样化的脑部改变。

Result: 在248例健康胎儿、26例CCD和47例其他脑病理的队列中验证，CCD病例性能大幅提升，胼胝体长度估计误差从10.9mm降至0.7mm，同时保持对其他病例的性能。

Conclusion: 将领域特异性解剖先验融入合成数据流程能有效缓解数据稀缺问题，增强对罕见但临床重要畸形的分析能力。

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

*Jeong Hun Yeo,Hyeongseop Rha,Sungjune Park,Junil Won,Yong Man Ro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个统一框架，能够同时处理手语、唇部动作和音频等多种模态，用于生成口语文本，在多个任务上达到或超越了最先进的专用模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音识别技术对聋人或听力障碍人群不可用，而视觉替代方案如手语和唇读虽然有效，但各模态研究孤立，缺乏统一框架来整合这些不同模态的输入。

Method: 设计了一个统一的模态无关架构，能够有效处理异构输入，探索模态间的协同作用（特别是唇部动作作为手语理解的非手动线索），并实现与专用模型相当或更优的性能。

Result: 在SLT、VSR、ASR和AVSR等多个任务上达到或超越了最先进的专用模型性能，分析发现将唇部动作作为独立模态显式建模能显著提升手语翻译性能。

Conclusion: 该统一框架成功整合了多种通信模态，证明了模态间协同效应的重要性，特别是唇部动作在手语理解中的关键作用，为无障碍通信技术提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

TL;DR: Video-MTR是一个强化多轮推理框架，通过迭代选择关键视频片段和问题理解来解决长视频理解问题，采用门控双层次奖励系统实现端到端训练，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解面临长程时间依赖和多个事件的挑战，现有方法依赖静态推理或外部视觉语言模型，存在复杂性高和端到端训练不足导致的性能不佳问题。

Method: 提出强化多轮推理框架Video-MTR，通过迭代选择视频片段并基于先前处理片段的理解进行渐进推理，引入门控双层次奖励系统（轨迹级和轮次级奖励）优化视频片段选择和问题理解。

Result: 在VideoMME、MLVU和EgoSchema等基准测试上的广泛实验表明，Video-MTR在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Video-MTR通过多轮迭代推理和门控奖励系统，无需外部视觉语言模型即可实现端到端训练，显著推进了长视频理解的技术水平。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

TL;DR: DUO：首个针对单目3D目标检测的双重不确定性优化TTA框架，通过联合最小化语义和几何不确定性，提升在域偏移下的检测鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTA方法未能解决M3OD中固有的双重不确定性（语义不确定性和几何不确定性），导致在真实世界域偏移下可靠性下降

Method: 提出双重不确定性优化框架：1）基于凸优化视角推导无监督焦点损失进行不确定性加权；2）设计语义感知法向场约束保持几何一致性；3）双分支互补机制

Result: 在多种数据集和域偏移类型上的大量实验表明，DUO优于现有方法

Conclusion: DUO通过联合优化语义和几何不确定性，显著提升了单目3D目标检测在域偏移条件下的鲁棒性和可靠性

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

Motivation: 3D点云异常检测因缺乏强大的预训练基础骨干网络而发展不足，而2D方法已有显著成功。需要利用2D预训练模型的优势来提升3D异常检测性能。

Method: 提出重要性感知集成网络(IAENet)，包含重要性感知融合(IAF)模块，动态评估各源模型的贡献并重新加权异常分数，设计关键损失函数指导IAF优化。

Result: 在MVTec 3D-AD数据集上的大量实验表明，IAENet达到了新的最先进水平，误报率显著降低。

Conclusion: IAENet通过有效整合2D和3D专家模型的集体知识并保持各自优势，显著提升了工业表面异常检测的实用价值。

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

TL;DR: DescriptiveEdit：一种基于描述性提示的图像编辑框架，通过将指令式编辑重新定义为基于参考图像的文本到图像生成，避免了重建误差和数据质量限制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成技术在语义图像编辑方面仍面临挑战，基于反转的方法会引入重建误差，而基于指令的方法受限于数据集质量和规模

Method: 提出DescriptiveEdit框架，采用交叉注意力UNet结构，通过注意力桥接机制将参考图像特征注入到提示词到编辑图像的生成过程中

Result: 在Emu Edit基准测试中显示出编辑准确性和一致性的提升，能够无缝集成ControlNet、IP-Adapter等扩展

Conclusion: 该方法克服了指令数据集质量的限制，保持了文本到图像模型的生成能力，具有更好的可扩展性

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it
improves editing accuracy and consistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DCFS框架，通过双路径特征一致性和置信度感知样本学习解决持续测试时适应中的伪标签质量问题和误差累积问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续测试时适应中，模型仅依赖目标域特征容易导致混淆和学习偏差，现有方法生成的伪标签质量无法保证且存在误差累积问题

Method: 使用双分类器将目标数据特征解耦为语义相关特征和域相关特征，保持子特征与整体特征一致性，并设置自适应阈值进行置信度加权的自监督学习

Result: 在CIFAR10-C、CIFAR100-C和ImageNet-C等多个数据集上验证了方法的有效性，在持续测试时适应场景中表现一致

Conclusion: DCFS框架能够从多角度全面捕捉数据特征，有效减少伪标签噪声并缓解误差累积问题

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机标定质量对新颖视角合成至关重要，1像素的标定误差会显著影响重建质量，但真实场景缺乏地面真值，需要通过新视角合成质量来评估标定质量

Method: 提出使用3D高斯散射（3DGS）模型，通过反向传播新视角颜色损失相对于相机参数的梯度来微调相机标定参数

Result: 在3DGS使用的参考数据集上，仅通过新的标定方法就实现了平均0.4 dB PSNR的提升

Conclusion: 虽然微调过程可能耗时且适用性取决于训练时间的关键性，但对于参考场景（如Mip-NeRF 360）的标定，新视角质量的重要性最为关键

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

Conclusion: 通过数据级早期融合和双向信息交换，有效利用了多模态数据的互补性，大幅提升了无监督3D目标检测的性能

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved

Motivation: 视频目标检测面临运动模糊、遮挡等图像退化问题，现有方法通过特征聚合和复杂后处理提升性能但计算成本高，需要在不增加推理负担的情况下提高鲁棒性

Method: 引入对比学习辅助分支(CLAB)增强主干网络特征表示能力，采用动态损失加权策略在训练早期强调辅助特征学习，后期逐渐侧重检测任务

Result: 在ImageNet VID数据集上，使用ResNet-101达到84.0% mAP，ResNeXt-101达到85.2% mAP，实现CNN模型的SOTA性能且无需额外后处理

Conclusion: CLAB方法有效提升了视频目标检测的鲁棒性，在不增加推理计算成本的情况下取得了优异的性能表现

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了CLIP视觉编码器在排版攻击下的行为，发现特定注意力头负责提取和传输排版信息，并提出了一种无需微调的选择性消融防御方法，显著提高了模型对排版攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 排版攻击通过向图像中注入文本来操纵多模态系统，导致目标错误分类、恶意内容生成和视觉语言模型越狱。需要研究CLIP模型在这种攻击下的行为并开发有效的防御方法。

Method: 定位CLIP模型后半层中专门处理排版信息的注意力头，构建排版电路，通过选择性消融这些注意力头来防御排版攻击，无需微调。

Result: 该方法在ImageNet-100的排版变体上性能提升高达19.6%，标准ImageNet-100准确率下降不到1%，与需要微调的最先进防御方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 提出的训练免费防御方法有效提升了CLIP模型对排版攻击的鲁棒性，发布的dyslexic CLIP模型可作为安全关键应用的即插即用替代方案。

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured
and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel
Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

TL;DR: FastFit是一个基于可缓存扩散架构的高速多参考虚拟试穿框架，通过半注意力机制和类别嵌入替代时间步嵌入，实现参考特征编码与去噪过程的完全解耦，获得3.5倍加速，并在多个数据集上达到最先进的保真度指标。


<details>

Motivation: 当前虚拟试穿技术面临两大挑战：无法支持多参考服装组合（包括服装和配饰），以及由于在每个去噪步骤中重复计算参考特征而导致的显著低效率。

Method: 提出FastFit框架，采用半注意力机制，用类别嵌入替代传统时间步嵌入，实现参考特征编码与去噪过程的完全解耦，参考特征只需计算一次即可在所有步骤中无损重用。同时构建了DressCode-MR大规模数据集，包含28,179组高质量配对图像。

Result: 在VITON-HD、DressCode和DressCode-MR数据集上的广泛实验表明，FastFit在关键保真度指标上超越了最先进的方法，同时实现了平均3.5倍的推理加速。

Conclusion: FastFit通过创新的可缓存扩散架构有效解决了多参考虚拟试穿的效率和能力问题，为复杂多参考虚拟试穿研究提供了新的解决方案和数据集支持。

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

Conclusion: UTA-Sign方法成功解决了低光照环境下交通标志感知的挑战，通过热成像和事件相机的互补融合提升了自动驾驶系统的环境理解能力

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Conclusion: 提出的主动防御方法通过低频扰动有效破坏了深度伪造的生成过程，为对抗深度伪造技术提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

Conclusion: 该方法为肝脏手术中术中超声与术前CT图像的配准提供了可靠准确的校准和体积重建手段，可增强术中引导效果

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)
scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an
optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver
images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration
error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT
scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and
volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound
images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance
intraoperative guidance.

Conclusion: PI-GenMFI方法能够有效生成合成MFI样本，为优化缺陷定位过程提供可行的解决方案，解决了MFI数据集稀缺的瓶颈问题

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising
results to optimize the defect localization process.

Conclusion: 提出的渐进式特征优化GAN框架有效解决了现有数据重建攻击的局限性，显著提升了隐私攻击的效果，揭示了分割推理中存在的严重隐私风险

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos
with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control
flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently
available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further
exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially
hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key
modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling,
emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法相比现有最先进方法有显著提升，能够有效弥补传统方法在艺术作品识别上的不足

Conclusion: 基础模型能够有效解决传统人脸识别在艺术作品上的局限性，为艺术史研究提供了更可靠的技术支持

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are
ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

*Ayan Banerjee,Fernando Vilariño,Josep Lladós*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CraftGraffiti是一个端到端的文本引导涂鸦生成框架，专注于在极端风格转换中保持面部身份识别性，通过风格优先、身份保持的范式实现高质量涂鸦生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在涂鸦这种高对比度、抽象的媒介中，微妙的面部特征扭曲会消除主体的可识别性，破坏个人和文化真实性，因此需要解决极端风格转换中的身份保持问题。

Method: 采用端到端文本引导框架，首先通过LoRA微调的预训练扩散transformer进行涂鸦风格迁移，然后通过面部一致性自注意力机制增强身份嵌入，使用CLIP引导的提示扩展实现无关键点的姿态定制。

Result: 定量结果显示竞争性的面部特征一致性和最先进的美学评分，定性分析和在Cruilla音乐节的现场部署展示了系统的实际创意影响力。

Conclusion: CraftGraffiti推进了身份尊重的AI辅助艺术目标，为创意AI应用中融合风格自由和可识别性提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的自评估方法，通过生成去偏自判断分数来改善大型视觉语言模型的模态对齐，减少幻觉并提高安全性，无需依赖外部资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在视觉和语言模态对齐方面存在挑战，容易产生幻觉和安全问题，现有方法依赖外部数据集和人工标注，成本高且扩展性差。

Method: 生成去偏自判断分数作为内部自评估指标，无需外部资源，通过改进解码策略和偏好调优过程来实现自主对齐改进。

Result: 实证结果显示该方法显著优于传统方法，有效减少幻觉、增强安全性并提升整体能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为LVLMs对齐提供了更有效的解决方案，具有更好的可扩展性和成本效益。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating
visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these
modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where
generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety
concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as
instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,
human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and
increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created
internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the
model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding
strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced
hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical
results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods,
offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态AI研究主要忽视了AI生成图像背后的意图，需要填补这一空白，开发能够识别内容意图的分类系统。

Method: 使用三种提示策略（图像引导、描述引导和多模态引导）通过Stable Diffusion构建合成训练数据集，并比较了多种模型架构包括模态融合、对比学习、重建网络、注意力机制和大规模视觉语言模型。

Result: 结果显示，在图像引导和多模态引导数据上训练的模型对真实内容具有更好的泛化能力，因为保留了视觉上下文。但整体性能仍然有限。

Conclusion: 推断意图具有复杂性，需要专门的架构来解决这一挑战，现有方法在意图识别方面仍有较大改进空间。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic
and out-of-context content. However, existing efforts largely overlook the
intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a
multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the
wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art,
or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies
(image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a
large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an
extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning,
reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language
models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided
data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual
context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the
complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

Conclusion: MobileCLIP2在低延迟移动设备上实现了最先进的零样本性能，证明了多模态强化训练方法的有效性，并发布了预训练模型和数据生成代码

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable
a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text
models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot
accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light
architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge
distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,
scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal
reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles
trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN
dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption
datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of
temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of
caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive
improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We
train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art
ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe
2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with
MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot
accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and
improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our
pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data
generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data
generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary
teachers using distributed scalable processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经视频压缩虽然性能显著，但学习型编解码器存在固有局限性，难以实现精确的码率控制，特别是在变比特率场景下

Method: 提出动态路由自编码器（DRA）具有可变编码路径，每条路径占用部分计算复杂度并对应不同的RD权衡；使用码率控制代理实时估计路径码率并调整编码路径；采用联合路径优化策略进行协同训练

Result: 在HEVC和UVG数据集上，相比最先进方法平均BD-Rate降低14.8%，BD-PSNR增益0.47dB，平均码率误差仅为1.66%

Conclusion: 该方法实现了各种比特率和比特率受限应用的率失真复杂度优化（RDCO），为神经视频压缩提供了有效的变比特率解决方案

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent
years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic
video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to
achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route
Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational
complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.
Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the
bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To
encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD
performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving
collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and
UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate
reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving
Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for various bitrate and
bitrate-constrained applications. Our code is available at

TL;DR: CardioMorphNet是一个基于贝叶斯深度学习的3D心脏形状引导可变形配准框架，通过循环变分自编码器建模心脏周期时空依赖，不使用基于强度的图像配准相似性损失，在心脏运动估计方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖基于强度的图像配准相似性损失，可能忽略心脏解剖区域，难以准确捕捉心脏运动。需要一种能够专注于解剖区域的心脏运动估计方法。

Method: 提出CardioMorphNet循环贝叶斯深度学习框架，使用循环变分自编码器建模时空依赖，两个后验模型分别用于双心室分割和运动估计，通过配准分割图而非强度图像来指导框架关注解剖区域。

Result: 在UK Biobank数据集上验证，CardioMorphNet在心脏运动估计方面表现优于最先进方法，且相比其他概率性心脏配准方法，在心脏区域产生更低的不确定性值，表明预测置信度更高。

Conclusion: CardioMorphNet通过形状引导的贝叶斯深度学习框架，成功解决了传统强度基方法忽略解剖区域的问题，在心脏运动估计方面取得了优越性能，并能提供可靠的不确定性评估。

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities.
Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they
rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook
cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a
recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided
deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a
recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over
the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and
motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation
guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering
segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity
loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The
Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the
estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing
warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates
superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields
lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region
compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,
indicating higher confidence in its predictions.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important histopathological markers yet
remain challenging to identify consistently, particularly under domain shift
stemming from scanner, stain, and acquisition differences. We present a simple
training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2.
The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted
at early and mid backbone stages, (ii) aligns attention-refined features across
sites using weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) through an
auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from
an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher with temperature-scaled KL
divergence. On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis
classification, our submission attains balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity
of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499. The method incurs
negligible inference-time overhead, relies only on coarse domain metadata, and
delivers strong, balanced performance, positioning it as a competitive
submission for the MIDOG 2025 challenge.

Motivation: 当前基于点式奖励模型的T2I生成方法容易受到奖励黑客攻击，微小分数差异在归一化后被放大，导致模型过度优化琐碎增益，破坏生成稳定性

Method: 提出Pref-GRPO方法：使用成对偏好奖励模型进行组内图像比较，以胜率作为奖励信号，将优化目标从分数最大化转向偏好拟合

Result: 实验表明Pref-GRPO能区分细微图像质量差异，提供更稳定的优势并缓解奖励黑客问题。同时开发UniGenBench基准，包含600个提示和37个评估标准

Conclusion: Pref-GRPO方法有效解决了奖励黑客问题，UniGenBench基准为T2I模型提供了更全面的评估框架，揭示了开源和闭源模型的优缺点

Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source
T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的特征学习约束机制，成功解决了稀疏视图下几何构建不准确的问题，实现了照片级真实感的合成效果

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen
scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements
utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters,
enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing
approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent
features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate
geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a
framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware,

lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion
and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有零样本3D视觉定位方法面临的单视角定位空间推理受限、上下文遗漏和细节退化等问题，提升在真实世界应用中的泛化能力。

Method: 首先通过3D语义分割网络生成3D实例提议并语义过滤，然后使用提议引导的多视角投影策略将候选提议投影到真实场景图像序列，最后通过动态调度机制迭代处理序列查询提示，利用VLM的跨模态推理能力识别文本指定对象。

Result: 在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中分别达到55.6%和53.2%的Acc@0.25分数，比之前的零样本方法分别提升了4.0%和5.2%。

Conclusion: SeqVLM框架显著提升了零样本3D视觉定位的性能，推动了3DVG向更好泛化能力和真实世界适用性的发展。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher
accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for
real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.
However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited
reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions
or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel
zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with
spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first
generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and
refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant
candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects
these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial
relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point
cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we
implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes
sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to
identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores
of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,
respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world
applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

Conclusion: 该方法通过模块化设计和因果链中间表示，实现了更透明、逻辑一致的因果推理，CCE可作为跨领域可重用的因果推理引擎

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle
with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that
entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These
black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on
shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly
decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language
causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human
cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level
video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and
logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal
Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,
and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in
these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a
scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing
datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation
metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art
models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and
generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine
across diverse domains. Project page:

Motivation: CLIP模型在军事应用中具有零样本分类优势，但其在遮挡和低信噪比等挑战性军事环境中的鲁棒性尚未充分探索

Method: 使用18类军事车辆自定义数据集，评估不同CLIP变体在不同遮挡比例下的性能，采用归一化曲线下面积(NAUC)作为评估指标

Result: 1) Transformer-based CLIP优于CNN模型 2) 细粒度分散遮挡比大块连续遮挡影响更大 3) 线性探测模型在35%遮挡时性能急剧下降 4) 骨干网络微调后性能下降延迟到60%遮挡

Conclusion: 需要在训练中加入遮挡特定增强，并进一步探索补丁级敏感性和架构韧性，以实现CLIP在真实军事部署中的应用

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for
defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in
challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP
variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle
classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across
occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP
models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions
degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite
improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around
35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop
occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of
occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further
exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for
real-world deployment of CLIP.

Result: 在CARLA平台对抗场景测试中，该架构相比先前方法获得了更优越的驾驶评分

Conclusion: SKGE-Swin架构通过结合Swin Transformer和跳跃连接，有效提升了自动驾驶模型的环境理解能力和性能表现

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with
pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin
architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage
mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network
levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant
pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head
Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the
initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its
capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The
model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to
simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous
methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the
contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip
connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model
performance.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了视频内容中抽象概念识别的挑战，认为基础模型的发展为解决这一难题提供了理想条件，并呼吁借鉴数十年社区经验来避免重复造轮子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然机器在视频内容理解方面取得显著进展，能够识别具体物体、动作和场景，但人类独有的抽象概念（如正义、自由、团结）识别能力仍然是开放挑战。自动理解高级抽象概念对于使模型更符合人类推理和价值观至关重要。

Method: 本文采用综述研究方法，系统研究了用于理解视频内容中抽象概念的不同任务和数据集，分析了研究人员在不同时期利用可用工具解决这些任务的尝试。

Result: 研究发现基础模型的进步为解决视频抽象概念理解提供了新的机遇，但需要借鉴过去数十年的社区经验来有效推进这一重要挑战。

Conclusion: 在多模态基础模型时代重新审视视频抽象概念理解这一重大开放挑战时，吸取社区长期积累的经验将有助于避免重复工作，推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered
by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable
of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be
objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique
ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts
like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a
crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple
semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue
that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to
address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of
high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more
aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different
tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We
observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted
to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their
disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help
us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing
the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation
models.

Conclusion: 该方法解决了现有可解释性方法的局限性，为医疗AI提供了更可靠和可信赖的诊断解释工具，有助于增强医生和患者对AI诊断的信任。

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly
improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic
performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a
challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are
essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with
LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods
failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose
Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses
all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel
level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps
reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML
enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and
patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient
safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and
Vision Transformers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了扩散分类器在组合泛化能力方面是否优于判别式模型（如CLIP和ViLT），特别是在属性绑定和关系推理任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言语义的一个基本方面是能够从已知部分组合出新含义。虽然视觉语言模型（VLMs）取得了显著进展，但有证据表明它们在组合泛化方面存在困难，例如无法正确绑定对象属性和关系。

Method: 评估了三种模型（扩散分类器、CLIP和ViLT）在零样本学习（ZSL）和广义零样本学习（GZSL）设置下绑定对象属性和关系的能力。分析了CLIP嵌入表示来探究关系推理困难的原因。

Result: 扩散分类器和ViLT在概念绑定任务上表现良好，但所有模型在关系GZSL任务上都面临显著困难。CLIP嵌入分析表明，困难可能源于关系概念（如左右）的表示过于相似。

Conclusion: 扩散分类器在组合泛化方面表现出一定优势，但所有视觉语言模型在关系推理方面都面临根本性挑战，需要进一步改进关系概念的表示学习。

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel
meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,
however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of
composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a
VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or
a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails
to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained
significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot
classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively
with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the
generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation
abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --
Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with
attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised
zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion
Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models
struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader
challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings
suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of
relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有点云配准方法忽略了点的方向和不确定性，对噪声输入和激进旋转（如正交变换）敏感，需要大量带变换增强的训练数据。

Method: 使用虚拟透视相机参数从激光雷达点云初始化面元，通过SE(3)等变卷积核学习包含位置和旋转的显式等变特征，预测源和目标扫描之间的相对变换。模型包括等变卷积编码器、交叉注意力机制、全连接解码器和非线性Huber损失。

Result: 在室内外数据集上的实验结果表明，该模型在真实点云扫描上相比最先进方法具有优越性和鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: 提出的面元位姿学习回归方法能够有效处理点云配准问题，特别是在面对噪声和激进旋转时表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of
multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital
heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both
non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point
uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive
rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it
necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations.
To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning
regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud
using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit
$\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation
through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative
transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an
equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity
computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss.
Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model
superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DVCTNet通过双视图协同训练和特征融合机制，有效提升了牙科龋齿检测的准确性和可靠性，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role
in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often
yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion
morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow
where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed
tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training
network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing
automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view
from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then
pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The
global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating
region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts
detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the
region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we
introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically
fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the
fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To
rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further
validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries
detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays
for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior
performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,
indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled
dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FusionCounting是一个新颖的多任务学习框架，将人群计数集成到可见光和红外图像融合过程中，通过动态损失权重和对抗训练提升融合质量和计数性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可见光红外图像融合方法主要关注图像质量优化，而结合下游任务的方法面临标注成本高或在拥挤场景中效果不佳的问题。人群计数提供了一种标注成本低的定量密度测量，特别适合密集场景。

Method: 提出FusionCounting多任务学习框架，将人群计数与图像融合相结合；采用动态损失函数权重策略加速收敛和平衡任务贡献；引入对抗训练增强模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在公共数据集上的实验结果表明，FusionCounting不仅提高了图像融合质量，还实现了优越的人群计数性能。

Conclusion: 该框架成功地将人群计数与图像融合集成到统一框架中，为密集场景下的多模态图像处理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on
optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating
downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to
provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires
extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation
efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes
due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd
counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have
integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these
challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework
that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a
direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,
making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both
input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial
multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,
we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and
crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial
attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that
FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves
superior crowd counting performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN和Transformer方法在小规模医疗数据集上容易过拟合，需要利用预训练VLMs的泛化能力来解决手术工具关键点检测问题

Method: 使用LoRA技术微调预训练VLMs，精心设计提示词构建指令调优数据集，将视觉特征与语义关键点描述对齐

Result: 仅需2个epoch的微调，适应后的VLM就超越了基线模型，证明了LoRA在低资源场景下的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了关键点检测性能，还为未来3D手术手和工具姿态估计研究奠定了基础

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical
tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank
adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in
small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization
capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an
instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic
keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of
fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the
ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only
improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work
in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了PointDGRWKV框架，这是首个基于RWKV架构的域泛化点云分类方法，通过自适应几何标记偏移和跨域关键特征分布对齐来解决RWKV在点云数据上的空间扭曲和注意力偏移问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有基于卷积网络、Transformer或Mamba架构的域泛化点云分类方法存在感受野有限、计算成本高或长程依赖建模不足的问题。RWKV架构具有线性复杂度、全局感受野和长程依赖优势，但直接应用于点云数据会遇到空间扭曲和注意力偏移挑战。

Method: 提出PointDGRWKV框架，包含两个关键模块：1）自适应几何标记偏移（Adaptive Geometric Token Shift）用于建模局部邻域结构，提高几何上下文感知；2）跨域关键特征分布对齐（Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment）通过跨域对齐关键特征分布来缓解注意力漂移。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，PointDGRWKV在域泛化点云分类任务上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PointDGRWKV成功将RWKV架构应用于域泛化点云分类，通过创新的几何建模和分布对齐方法解决了RWKV在点云数据上的局限性，同时保持了RWKV的线性效率优势。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the
generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen
domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba
architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high
computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an
emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive
fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work
that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that
directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's
fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial
distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local
geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention
in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through
exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.
To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored
for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and
cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In
particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local
neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,
Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate
attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves
state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved
diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its
clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of
traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning
architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at
the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By
localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives,
these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for
dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose
PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological
image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR
generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting
cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our
approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly
developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets
demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual
reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and
cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for
improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will
be publicly available in https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/PathMR.

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms
of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late
detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for
early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging:
autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique
patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of
distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology
evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).
Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant
challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class
imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet
architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training,
achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant
improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for
clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC
detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a
foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed
methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to
limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical
applications.

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying
inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to
interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use
counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and
generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful
attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious
correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution
(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions
rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept
Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like
backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that
perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum
learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy
while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides
a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying
identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age
affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal
graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular,
training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal
sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for
interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative
models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias
evaluation and mitigation.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that
decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While
interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited
inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that
integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving
robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable
outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified
perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes
methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.
We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and
systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training
strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting
future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive
framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates
fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust,
generalizable, and interpretable perception.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a
powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively
transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel
encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense
features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an
encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized
adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial
details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality
reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that
effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted
extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation
datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging
modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation
accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the
7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the
superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model
provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. The code is available at

Motivation: 有丝分裂象是肿瘤分级的重要生物标志物，但区分非典型有丝分裂象和正常有丝分裂象困难，人工标注耗时且主观

Method: 使用AUCMEDI训练ConvNeXtBase模型集成，并添加基于规则的细化模块(RBR)

Result: 集成模型在MIDOG25测试集上平衡准确率达84.02%，RBR提高了特异性但降低了敏感性和整体性能

Conclusion: 深度集成模型在非典型有丝分裂象分类中表现良好，基于规则的细化可以提升特定指标但需要进一步研究

Abstract: Mitotic figures (MFs) are relevant biomarkers in tumor grading.
Differentiating atypical MFs (AMFs) from normal MFs (NMFs) remains difficult,
as manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective. In this work an ensemble
of ConvNeXtBase models was trained with AUCMEDI and extend with a rule-based
refinement (RBR) module. On the MIDOG25 preliminary test set, the ensemble
achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02%. While the RBR increased specificity, it
reduced sensitivity and overall performance. The results show that deep
ensembles perform well for AMF classification. RBR can increase specific
metrics but requires further research.

Conclusion: 为CERN粒子物理实验中的高效探测器模拟提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner
workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such
simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which
are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's
computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine
learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the
distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is
hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present
ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree
Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a
Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in
simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and
efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of
the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also
provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods,
offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in
particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for
ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of
recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.
Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data
to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.
First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which
struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,
they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is
essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in
handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot
handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent
text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to
better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We
further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages
high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated
samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that
aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby
enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting
datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent
handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource
handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines. Official implementation is available

Abstract: Many high-performance networks were not designed with lightweight application
scenarios in mind from the outset, which has greatly restricted their scope of
application. This paper takes ConvNeXt as the research object and significantly
reduces the parameter scale and network complexity of ConvNeXt by integrating
the Cross Stage Partial Connections mechanism and a series of optimized
designs. The new network is named E-ConvNeXt, which can maintain high accuracy
performance under different complexity configurations. The three core
innovations of E-ConvNeXt are : (1) integrating the Cross Stage Partial Network
(CSPNet) with ConvNeXt and adjusting the network structure, which reduces the
model's network complexity by up to 80%; (2) Optimizing the Stem and Block
structures to enhance the model's feature expression capability and operational
efficiency; (3) Replacing Layer Scale with channel attention. Experimental
validation on ImageNet classification demonstrates E-ConvNeXt's superior
accuracy-efficiency balance: E-ConvNeXt-mini reaches 78.3% Top-1 accuracy at
0.9GFLOPs. E-ConvNeXt-small reaches 81.9% Top-1 accuracy at 3.1GFLOPs. Transfer
learning tests on object detection tasks further confirm its generalization

Conclusion: HydraFake数据集和Veritas检测器有效解决了深度伪造检测在现实世界中的泛化挑战，通过分层测试框架和模式感知推理机制提升了检测性能的可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and
evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing
academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,
typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing
images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To
mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world
challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake
involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with
rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,
emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,
we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake
detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce
pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as
"planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake
reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset
reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on
cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.
Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is
capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose
significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the
manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the
main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe
lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we
introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily
available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images
from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a
simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.
Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and
accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve
annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out
unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually
forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than
existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object
Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating
high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a
new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for
the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and
significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world
forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a
striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1
average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了当前深度伪造检测方法在应对局部视频操作时的紧急漏洞，提供了必要的资源来开发更强大的检测方法，以应对这种新型的局部深度伪造威胁。

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle,
localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of
otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial
manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions
and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them
particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in
detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial
deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level
manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of
detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human
detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar
performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This
work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection
approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods

Method: 采用两阶段蒸馏过程：1）稳定性预热机制稳定对抗蒸馏；2）统一对抗均衡机制促进稳定的单步对抗训练；同时提出条件对抗一致性方法来改善条件视频生成的语义和帧一致性。

Result: 在VBench-I2V上平均提升7.15%的语义对齐、时间连贯性和帧质量，将预训练模型的延迟减少100倍（从1000秒到10秒）。

Conclusion: POSE成功解决了大规模视频扩散模型采样效率低下的问题，实现了高质量单步视频生成，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in
sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.
Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer
from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of
video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.
To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a
distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video
diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single
step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video
models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial
distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator
from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of
single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified
adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism
that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash
equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step
videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)
conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic
consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated
frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other
acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,
temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained
model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining
competitive performance.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are
computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency,
we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated
prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models,
where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We
propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic
similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show
that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach
significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging
UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater
efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales
with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of
large-scale text-to-image generation. Project page:

*Gennaro Percannella,Mattia Sarno,Francesco Tortorella,Mario Vento*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于Mamba架构的VM-UNet方法用于组织病理学图像中的有丝分裂检测，通过染色增强操作提升模型在域偏移情况下的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习算法在组织病理学图像有丝分裂检测中遇到域偏移时性能显著下降的问题

Method: 采用VM-UNet架构结合染色增强操作，提高模型对域偏移的鲁棒性

Result: 在MIDOG++数据集上的初步实验显示该方法仍有很大的改进空间

Conclusion: Mamba-based方法在有丝分裂检测领域泛化方面具有潜力，但需要进一步优化

Abstract: Mitosis detection in histopathology images plays a key role in tumor
assessment. Although machine learning algorithms could be exploited for aiding
physicians in accurately performing such a task, these algorithms suffer from
significative performance drop when evaluated on images coming from domains
that are different from the training ones. In this work, we propose a
Mamba-based approach for mitosis detection under domain shift, inspired by the
promising performance demonstrated by Mamba in medical imaging segmentation
tasks. Specifically, our approach exploits a VM-UNet architecture for carrying
out the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further
improving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been
submitted to the track 1 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG)
challenge. Preliminary experiments, conducted on the MIDOG++ dataset, show
large room for improvement for the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别组织病理学图像中的非典型有丝分裂有助于医生正确评估肿瘤侵袭性，但机器学习模型在域偏移下会出现显著性能下降。

Method: 采用多任务学习方法，利用与主要分类任务相关的辅助任务，帮助模型专注于分类对象而忽略图像中域变化的背景。

Result: 在三个不同数据集（MIDOG 2025非典型训练集、Ami-Br数据集和MIDOG25挑战赛初步测试集）上的初步评估显示出有希望的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的多任务学习方法在解决域偏移问题上表现出潜力，能够提高模型在非典型有丝分裂识别任务中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images allows
physicians to correctly assess tumor aggressiveness. Although machine learning
models could be exploited for automatically performing such a task, under
domain shift these models suffer from significative performance drops. In this
work, an approach based on multi-task learning is proposed for addressing this
problem. By exploiting auxiliary tasks, correlated to the main classification
task, the proposed approach, submitted to the track 2 of the MItosis DOmain
Generalization (MIDOG) challenge, aims to aid the model to focus only on the
object to classify, ignoring the domain varying background of the image. The
proposed approach shows promising performance in a preliminary evaluation
conducted on three distinct datasets, i.e., the MIDOG 2025 Atypical Training
Set, the Ami-Br dataset, as well as the preliminary test set of the MIDOG25

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMG-Vid是一个无需训练的视觉token剪枝框架，通过最大化边际增益在segment和token两个层级去除冗余，在保持99.5%性能的同时减少75%视觉token并加速3.9倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频大语言模型的视觉token过多导致计算效率低下，现有方法未考虑视频的动态特性和时间依赖性

Method: 提出segment级和token级最大化边际增益策略：基于帧相似性分割视频并动态分配token预算，使用时序引导的DPC算法联合建模帧间独特性和帧内多样性

Result: 在LLaVA-OneVision-7B上保持99.5%原始性能，减少75%视觉token，预填充阶段加速3.9倍

Conclusion: MMG-Vid通过最大化有限token预算的利用率，在显著提升效率的同时保持了强大的性能表现

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their
excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for
real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by
visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics
and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding
as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel
training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by
Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,
we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then
dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal
gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm
that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby
maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid
can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly
improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original
performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the
prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CogVLA是一个认知对齐的视觉-语言-动作框架，通过指令驱动路由和稀疏化技术，在提高效率的同时实现最先进性能，相比OpenVLA减少2.5倍训练成本和2.8倍推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型需要大量后训练，导致计算开销大，限制了可扩展性和部署。受人类多模态协调启发，需要开发更高效的框架。

Method: 采用3阶段渐进架构：1) EFA-Routing在视觉编码器中注入指令信息选择性聚合压缩视觉token；2) LFP-Routing在语言模型中引入动作意图，剪枝指令无关的视觉token实现token级稀疏；3) V-L-A耦合注意力结合因果视觉语言注意力和双向动作并行解码。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试和真实机器人任务中分别达到97.4%和70.0%的成功率，实现最先进性能，同时训练成本降低2.5倍，推理延迟减少2.8倍。

Conclusion: CogVLA通过认知对齐的指令驱动路由和稀疏化技术，在显著提高效率的同时实现了卓越的性能，为视觉-语言-动作模型提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing
training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold
compared to OpenVLA. CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 首个数据驱动的多视角3D点追踪器，使用少量相机（如4个）即可在线追踪动态场景中的任意点，解决了单目追踪的深度模糊和遮挡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单目追踪器存在深度模糊和遮挡问题，而传统多相机方法需要20+相机且需要逐序列优化，缺乏实用的在线追踪方案

Method: 基于已知相机位姿和多视角深度信息，融合多视角特征到统一点云，使用k近邻关联和基于transformer的更新机制来估计长距离3D对应关系

Result: 在Panoptic Studio和DexYCB基准测试中分别达到3.1cm和2.0cm的中位轨迹误差，可泛化到1-8个不同视角相机和24-150帧视频长度

Conclusion: 该方法为多视角3D追踪研究设立了新标准，提供了实用的实时应用工具，并发布了追踪器及训练评估数据集

Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to
track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike
existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and
occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and
tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D
correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling
robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either
sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view
features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation
alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D
correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view
Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and
DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying
vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker
alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for
multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world
applications. Project page available at https://ethz-vlg.github.io/mvtracker.

TL;DR: OneReward是一个统一的强化学习框架，使用单一奖励模型提升多任务生成能力，在图像编辑任务中超越了商业和开源竞争对手


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖任务特定的监督微调，限制了泛化能力和训练效率，需要一种统一的框架来处理多任务生成问题

Method: 使用单一视觉语言模型作为生成奖励模型，通过多任务强化学习直接训练预训练基础模型，无需任务特定的监督微调

Result: 实验结果表明，统一的编辑模型在多个评估维度上持续优于商业和开源竞争对手，如Ideogram、Adobe Photoshop和FLUX Fill [Pro]

Conclusion: OneReward框架成功证明了使用单一奖励模型可以有效提升多任务生成能力，为多任务生成模型提供了高效的训练方案

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning
framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple
tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model.
By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward
model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given
evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation
models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives.
We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further
divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object
removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although
these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ
significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing
methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits
generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop
Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task
reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the
need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified
edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source
competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across
multiple evaluation dimensions. Code and model are available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对NeurIPS 2024挑战赛的获胜水印移除方案，分别在黑盒和米色盒场景下实现了95.7%的近完美水印移除效果，同时对图像质量影响极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试现有水印技术对对抗攻击的鲁棒性，推动更强大水印方法的发展。当前水印技术是否能够抵御不同程度的对抗攻击尚不明确。

Method: 米色盒场景：使用自适应VAE规避攻击，结合测试时优化和CIELAB空间颜色对比度恢复来保持图像质量。黑盒场景：首先基于空间或频域伪影对图像聚类，然后对每个聚类应用带控制噪声注入的图像到图像扩散模型，并利用ChatGPT生成标题的语义先验。

Result: 实证评估显示该方法成功实现了近完美水印移除（95.7%），对残余图像质量影响可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 该攻击方法有望激发更鲁棒的图像水印技术的发展，为数字媒体认证和版权保护提供重要参考。

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and
copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing
watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning
solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which
stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.
The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,
depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by
the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based
evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in
CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first
cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.
Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection
and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with
optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method
successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible
impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the
development of more robust image watermarking methods.

Abstract: Pretrained multilingual models exhibit the same social bias as models
processing English texts. This systematic review analyzes emerging research
that extends bias evaluation and mitigation approaches into multilingual and
non-English contexts. We examine these studies with respect to linguistic
diversity, cultural awareness, and their choice of evaluation metrics and
mitigation techniques. Our survey illuminates gaps in the field's dominant
methodological design choices (e.g., preference for certain languages, scarcity
of multilingual mitigation experiments) while cataloging common issues
encountered and solutions implemented in adapting bias benchmarks across
languages and cultures. Drawing from the implications of our findings, we chart
directions for future research that can reinforce the multilingual bias
literature's inclusivity, cross-cultural appropriateness, and alignment with
state-of-the-art NLP advancements.

Motivation: 降低人工测试开发成本和不一致性，为K-12教育提供可扩展的语言评估项目开发方法。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：比较微调中等模型与未调优大型模型；评估七种结构化提示策略(零样本、少样本、思维链、基于角色、顺序等组合)。使用自动化指标和专家评分五个维度评估生成项目，并用GPT-4.1模拟大规模人工评分。

Result: 结构化提示策略(特别是思维链与顺序设计组合)显著提升Gemma输出质量；Gemma比GPT-3.5的零样本响应产生更多结构对齐和教学适宜的项目；提示设计在中型模型性能中起关键作用。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和高效微调可在有限数据条件下增强中型模型的自动生成能力；结合自动化指标、专家判断和大模型模拟能确保与评估目标的一致性；提出的工作流程为K-12语言评估项目开发提供了实用且可扩展的方法。

Abstract: This study explores automatic generation (AIG) using language models to
create multiple choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessment, aiming to
reduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development. The study used a
two-fold approach. First, we compared a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B)
with a larger untuned one (GPT-3.5, 175B). Second, we evaluated seven
structured prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Generated items
were assessed using automated metrics and expert scoring across five
dimensions. We also used GPT-4.1, trained on expert-rated samples, to simulate
human scoring at scale. Results show that structured prompting, especially
strategies combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, significantly
improved Gemma's outputs. Gemma generally produced more construct-aligned and
instructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses, with
prompt design playing a key role in mid-size model performance. This study
demonstrates that structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance
midsized models for AIG under limited data conditions. We highlight the value
of combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation to
ensure alignment with assessment goals. The proposed workflow offers a
practical and scalable way to develop and validate language assessment items
for K-12.

Abstract: The growing complexity of cyber-physical systems, particularly in automotive
applications, has increased the demand for efficient modeling and cross-domain
co-simulation techniques. While SystemC Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM)
enables effective hardware/software co-design, its limited interoperability
with models from other engineering domains poses integration challenges. This
paper presents a fully open-source methodology for integrating SystemC TLM
models into Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)-based co-simulation workflows.
By encapsulating SystemC TLM components as FMI 3.0 Co Simulation Functional
Mock-up Units (FMUs), the proposed approach facilitates seamless, standardized
integration across heterogeneous simulation environments. We introduce a
lightweight open-source toolchain, address key technical challenges such as
time synchronization and data exchange, and demonstrate the feasibility and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 紧凑语言模型（如0.5B参数）由于推理能力差，在强化学习训练中面临稀疏奖励和不稳定的问题，难以实现智能RAG行为。

Method: 提出蒸馏引导策略优化（DGPO），包括从教师演示进行冷启动初始化，以及在策略优化过程中提供持续的教师指导。

Result: DGPO使紧凑模型能够实现复杂的智能搜索行为，在某些情况下甚至超越了更大的教师模型。

Conclusion: DGPO使得在计算资源受限的环境中实现智能RAG成为可能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit
agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models.
However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor
reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To
overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization
(DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from
teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy
optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG
Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search
coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search
behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO
makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUARD是一种将政府AI伦理指南转化为可操作测试问题的方法，通过自动生成违反指南的问题来评估LLM合规性，并引入越狱诊断来识别潜在安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在各领域的广泛应用，其可能生成有害内容的问题引发了社会关注。政府发布的伦理指南多为高层级要求，缺乏具体测试方法，需要将其转化为可操作的测试问题来验证LLM合规性。

Method: 提出GUARD方法：1）基于政府指南自动生成违反指南的测试问题；2）对不直接违反指南的响应，引入GUARD-JD越狱诊断，创建场景诱发不道德响应；3）生成合规报告，详细说明遵守程度和违规情况。

Result: 在7个LLM（包括Vicuna-13B、Llama系列、GPT系列和Claude-3.7）上实证验证有效性，测试了三个政府指南的合规性并进行了越狱诊断。GUARD-JD还可迁移到视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: GUARD提供了一种系统化的方法来将高层级伦理指南转化为具体测试，有效评估LLM合规性并识别安全机制可能被绕过的场景，有助于促进可靠的LLM应用开发。

Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains,
their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal
and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines
to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are
typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in
translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline
\textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and
Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize
guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM
adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of
guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby
testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly
violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses
that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of
``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that
provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying
potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method
finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence
and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,
including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued
guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can
transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its
usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

TL;DR: JERR是一个新颖的图推理框架，通过摘要提取、图构建和关系推理三个关键组件，提升大语言模型在长上下文理解中的表现，解决了内存限制和幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理长上下文时面临内存限制和复杂任务处理困难，同时缺乏透明度且容易产生幻觉，需要新的解决方案来提升长文本理解能力。

Method: 采用三步框架：1) 策略性文本分块提取摘要；2) 构建有向无环图解决冗余问题；3) 整合蒙特卡洛树搜索辅助复杂推理路径导航。

Result: 实验结果显示JERR在ROUGE和F1指标上持续优于所有基线模型，在LLM-Rater评估中获得最高分数。

Conclusion: JERR框架为大语言模型处理扩展上下文和复杂推理任务提供了新颖解决方案，显著提升了可靠性和透明度。

Abstract: Despite significant progress, large language models (LLMs) still struggle
with long contexts due to memory limitations and their inability to tackle
complex and long-context tasks. Additionally, LLMs often suffer from a lack of
transparency and are prone to producing hallucinations. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{JERR}, a novel framework designed to enhance
long-context comprehension via graph-based reasoning in LLMs. JERR integrates
three key components: synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational
reasoning. First, synopsis is extracted by chunking text strategically,
allowing the model to summarize and understand information more efficiently.
Second, we build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to resolve redundancy, ensuring
logical consistency and clarity. Finally, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to help the model navigate complex reasoning paths, ensuring more
accurate and interpretable outputs. This framework provides a novel solution
that enables LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with
improved reliability and transparency. Experimental results show that JERR
consistently outperforms all baselines on the ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving
the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.

chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT
behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are
typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving
scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH)
graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require
deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are
core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we
develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long CoT Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially
enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a
fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. Our flagship
model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics,
coding, STEM, and logic, and surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both
accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as
an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs,
opening a new frontier for LLM post-training. Our implementation is available

in our Hugging Face collection HKUST-DSAIL/Graph-R1.

### [106] [CAPE: Context-Aware Personality Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20385)
*Jivnesh Sandhan,Fei Cheng,Tushar Sandhan,Yugo Murawaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个上下文感知人格评估框架CAPE，通过引入对话历史来评估大语言模型的人格特质，发现上下文能提高响应一致性但也会导致人格偏移，不同模型对上下文依赖程度不同


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理测量测试采用无上下文方法评估LLMs，忽略了真实对话中历史交互对响应的影响，需要开发上下文感知的评估框架

Method: 提出CAPE框架，引入对话历史作为上下文，设计新指标量化LLM响应一致性，在7个LLM上进行实验分析

Result: 对话历史通过上下文学习提高响应一致性但导致人格偏移；GPT模型对问题顺序鲁棒，Gemini和Llama敏感；GPT响应源于内在人格和交互历史，而Gemini和Llama严重依赖历史

Conclusion: 上下文依赖的人格偏移能提高响应一致性并更好符合人类判断，为LLM人格评估提供了更真实的框架

Abstract: Psychometric tests, traditionally used to assess humans, are now being
applied to Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate their behavioral traits.
However, existing studies follow a context-free approach, answering each
question in isolation to avoid contextual influence. We term this the Disney
World test, an artificial setting that ignores real-world applications, where
conversational history shapes responses. To bridge this gap, we propose the
first Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework for LLMs,
incorporating prior conversational interactions. To thoroughly analyze the
influence of context, we introduce novel metrics to quantify the consistency of
LLM responses, a fundamental trait in human behavior.
  Our exhaustive experiments on 7 LLMs reveal that conversational history
enhances response consistency via in-context learning but also induces
personality shifts, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo exhibiting extreme
deviations. While GPT models are robust to question ordering, Gemini-1.5-Flash
and Llama-8B display significant sensitivity. Moreover, GPT models response
stem from their intrinsic personality traits as well as prior interactions,
whereas Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama--8B heavily depend on prior interactions.
Finally, applying our framework to Role Playing Agents (RPAs) shows
context-dependent personality shifts improve response consistency and better
align with human judgments. Our code and datasets are publicly available at:

### [107] [Measuring Reasoning Utility in LLMs via Conditional Entropy Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20395)
*Xu Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现推理步骤中的条件熵变化模式与答案正确性相关：熵递减通常对应正确答案，熵持平或递增则往往导致错误答案，错误推理路径通常更长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型依赖中间推理步骤提高准确性，但缺乏对推理步骤效用如何影响最终答案正确性的研究。由于自回归生成的随机性，生成更多上下文并不保证答案置信度提升。

Method: 在MATH数据集上进行oracle研究，使用Qwen2.5-32B和GPT-4o生成推理链，然后用Qwen3-8B量化这些推理链对最终准确性的效用。通过条件熵（词汇表上的期望负对数似然）测量模型在每个推理步骤中对答案Y的不确定性。

Result: 发现明显模式：条件熵随步骤递减与正确答案强相关，而熵持平或递增往往导致错误答案。错误推理路径通常比正确路径更长，表明更长的推理不一定产生更好结果。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计高效推理流程提供了基础，可早期检测和避免无效推理，从而优化大语言模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) often rely on generating
intermediate reasoning steps to enhance accuracy. However, little work has
examined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness.
Due to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more
context does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could
predict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could
stop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final
decision.
  We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to
generate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to
quantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we
measure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step
using conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the
vocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear
pattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated
with correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong
answers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer
than correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield
better outcomes. These findings serve as a foundation to inspire future work on
designing efficient reasoning pipelines that detect and avoid unproductive
reasoning early.

TL;DR: DentalBench是首个针对牙科领域的双语基准测试，包含问答数据集和大规模语料库，评估显示现有LLMs在牙科专业领域存在显著性能差距，领域适应能显著提升模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在通用医疗基准上表现良好，但在需要深度专业知识的牙科等专业医学领域能力尚未充分探索，缺乏针对性评估资源。

Method: 构建DentalBench基准：1）DentalQA：36,597个中英文问答问题，覆盖4个任务和16个牙科子领域；2）DentalCorpus：3.37亿token的大规模高质量牙科语料库，支持监督微调和检索增强生成。评估14个LLMs并分析性能差距。

Result: 评估显示不同模型在任务类型和语言上存在显著性能差距。使用Qwen-2.5-3B进行的领域适应实验表明，领域适应能显著提升模型性能，特别是在知识密集和术语集中的任务上。

Conclusion: 领域特定基准测试对于开发适用于医疗保健应用的可信有效LLMs至关重要，牙科领域的专业评估揭示了现有模型的局限性，领域适应是提升专业领域性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and medical LLMs (Med-LLMs)
have demonstrated strong performance on general medical benchmarks. However,
their capabilities in specialized medical fields, such as dentistry which
require deeper domain-specific knowledge, remain underexplored due to the lack
of targeted evaluation resources. In this paper, we introduce DentalBench, the
first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate and advance LLMs
in the dental domain. DentalBench consists of two main components: DentalQA, an
English-Chinese question-answering (QA) benchmark with 36,597 questions
spanning 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields; and DentalCorpus, a large-scale,
high-quality corpus with 337.35 million tokens curated for dental domain
adaptation, supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate 14 LLMs, covering
proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models, and reveal significant
performance gaps across task types and languages. Further experiments with
Qwen-2.5-3B demonstrate that domain adaptation substantially improves model
performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks,
and highlight the importance of domain-specific benchmarks for developing
trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications.

TL;DR: KG-CQR是一个新颖的框架，通过知识图谱增强检索增强生成系统的查询表示，在多个数据集上取得了4-6%的mAP提升和2-3%的Recall@25提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要解决语料库级别的上下文丢失问题，但缺乏对复杂查询的语义丰富表示。知识图谱与大语言模型结合有潜力改进检索阶段的性能

Method: 提出KG-CQR框架，包含子图提取、补全和上下文生成模块，通过结构化关系表示来丰富查询上下文，是一个模型无关的管道方法

Result: 在RAGBench和MultiHop-RAG数据集上表现出色，mAP提升4-6%，Recall@25提升2-3%。在多跳问答等挑战性任务中检索效果持续优于基线

Conclusion: KG-CQR通过知识图谱的查询增强有效提升了检索增强生成系统的性能，具有模型无关性和可扩展性优势

Abstract: The integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) with large language models (LLMs)
offers significant potential to improve the retrieval phase of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. In this study, we propose KG-CQR,
a novel framework for Contextual Query Retrieval (CQR) that enhances the
retrieval phase by enriching the contextual representation of complex input
queries using a corpus-centric KG. Unlike existing methods that primarily
address corpus-level context loss, KG-CQR focuses on query enrichment through
structured relation representations, extracting and completing relevant KG
subgraphs to generate semantically rich query contexts. Comprising subgraph
extraction, completion, and contextual generation modules, KG-CQR operates as a
model-agnostic pipeline, ensuring scalability across LLMs of varying sizes
without additional training. Experimental results on RAGBench and MultiHop-RAG
datasets demonstrate KG-CQR's superior performance, achieving a 4-6%
improvement in mAP and a 2-3% improvement in Recall@25 over strong baseline
models. Furthermore, evaluations on challenging RAG tasks such as multi-hop
question answering show that, by incorporating KG-CQR, the performance
consistently outperforms the existing baseline in terms of retrieval
effectiveness

Motivation: 当前LLM评估主要关注数学和编程推理任务，缺乏针对民航维修等专业垂直领域的专门评估工具，而该领域具有严格的行业标准和复杂的知识密集型任务需求

Method: 设计并开发了民航维修专用的工业级基准测试，用于评估LLM在领域知识和复杂推理方面的能力，同时评估现有向量嵌入模型和LLM在RAG系统中的应用效果

Result: 通过实验探索和分析，证明了该基准测试在评估模型性能方面的有效性，并将评估基准和代码开源以促进进一步研究

Conclusion: 该工作填补了当前LLM评估的空白，为民航维修领域提供了标准化的评估工具，有助于推动该领域智能化解决方案的发展

Abstract: Civil aviation maintenance is a domain characterized by stringent industry
standards. Within this field, maintenance procedures and troubleshooting
represent critical, knowledge-intensive tasks that require sophisticated
reasoning. To address the lack of specialized evaluation tools for large
language models (LLMs) in this vertical, we propose and develop an
industrial-grade benchmark specifically designed for civil aviation
maintenance. This benchmark serves a dual purpose: It provides a standardized
tool to measure LLM capabilities within civil aviation maintenance, identifying
specific gaps in domain knowledge and complex reasoning. By pinpointing these
deficiencies, the benchmark establishes a foundation for targeted improvement
efforts (e.g., domain-specific fine-tuning, RAG optimization, or specialized
prompt engineering), ultimately facilitating progress toward more intelligent
solutions within civil aviation maintenance. Our work addresses a significant
gap in the current LLM evaluation, which primarily focuses on mathematical and
coding reasoning tasks. In addition, given that Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems are currently the dominant solutions in practical applications ,
we leverage this benchmark to evaluate existing well-known vector embedding
models and LLMs for civil aviation maintenance scenarios. Through experimental
exploration and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in
assessing model performance within this domain, and we open-source this
evaluation benchmark and code to foster further research and
development:https://github.com/CamBenchmark/cambenchmark

Method: 使用TF-IDF进行文本向量化处理，采用余弦相似度计算相似性值，支持标题和关键词两种搜索方式

Result: 在705个实践工作标题的测试中，随机化标题搜索阶段获得了相同数量的匹配标题和更高的平均匹配分数

Conclusion: 该系统能够有效搜索实践工作标题，即使在输入标题被随机化的情况下仍能保持稳定的搜索性能

Abstract: Case Base Reasoning (CBR) is a case solving technique based on experience in
cases that have occurred before with the highest similarity. CBR is used to
search for practical work titles. TF-IDF is applied to process the
vectorization of each practical work title word and Cosine Similarity for the
calculation of similarity values. This system can search either in the form of
titles or keywords. The output of the system is the title of practical work and
the match value of each title. Based on the test results using 705 practical
work titles, testing was carried out with five titles and carried out in two
stages. The first stage searches with existing titles and the second stage
randomizes the title from the first stage. And the results obtained in the
second stage are the same number of titles found and the highest average match
score.

Abstract: We introduce MCP-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) on realistic, multi-step tasks that demand tool use, cross-tool
coordination, precise parameter control, and planning/reasoning for solving
tasks. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), MCP-Bench connects LLMs to 28
representative live MCP servers spanning 250 tools across domains such as
finance, traveling, scientific computing, and academic search. Unlike prior
API-based benchmarks, each MCP server provides a set of complementary tools
designed to work together, enabling the construction of authentic, multi-step
tasks with rich input-output coupling. Tasks in MCP-Bench test agents' ability
to retrieve relevant tools from fuzzy instructions without explicit tool names,
plan multi-hop execution trajectories for complex objectives, ground responses
in intermediate tool outputs, and orchestrate cross-domain workflows -
capabilities not adequately evaluated by existing benchmarks that rely on
explicit tool specifications, shallow few-step workflows, and isolated domain
operations. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework covering tool-level
schema understanding and usage, trajectory-level planning, and task completion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种整合多模态电子健康记录的深度学习框架，通过自然语言处理技术预测ICU患者的死亡率和资源利用情况，在三个临床任务上均优于现有方法，并表现出对结构化数据损坏的强鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注结构化电子健康记录，忽略了自由文本笔记中的宝贵临床信息，且未充分利用结构化数据中的文本信息潜力。需要开发能够整合多模态数据的预测模型来优化ICU患者预后和成本管理。

Method: 使用两个真实世界电子健康记录数据集，开发了基于自然语言处理技术的深度学习框架，包含医疗提示、自由文本和预训练句子编码器三个关键组件，并与领先的现有方法进行对比评估。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的三个临床任务中，模型性能显著提升：死亡率预测BACC/AUROC提高1.6%/0.8%，住院时间预测RMSE/MAE降低0.5%/2.2%，手术时长估计RMSE/MAE降低10.9%/11.0%，在不同损坏率下均表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架是预测重症监护死亡率和资源利用的有效准确方法，展示了使用提示学习和transformer编码器分析多模态电子健康记录的成功，特别在高损坏水平下表现出强大的数据损坏抵抗能力。

Abstract: Background Predicting mortality and resource utilization from electronic
health records (EHRs) is challenging yet crucial for optimizing patient
outcomes and managing costs in intensive care unit (ICU). Existing approaches
predominantly focus on structured EHRs, often ignoring the valuable clinical
insights in free-text notes. Additionally, the potential of textual information
within structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce
and assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing
techniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource
utilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR
datasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with
leading existing methods. We also performed an ablation study on three key
components in our framework: medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained
sentence encoder. Furthermore, we assessed the model's robustness against the
corruption in structured EHRs. Results Our experiments on two real-world
datasets across three clinical tasks showed that our proposed model improved
performance metrics by 1.6\%/0.8\% on BACC/AUROC for mortality prediction,
0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE for LOS prediction, 10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE for surgical
duration estimation compared to the best existing methods. It consistently
demonstrated superior performance compared to other baselines across three
tasks at different corruption rates. Conclusions The proposed framework is an
effective and accurate deep learning approach for predicting mortality and
resource utilization in critical care. The study also highlights the success of
using prompt learning with a transformer encoder in analyzing multimodal EHRs.
Importantly, the model showed strong resilience to data corruption within
structured data, especially at high corruption levels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阴谋论侵蚀公众对科学和机构的信任，且随着AI生成虚假信息的日益复杂，理解阴谋论内容的修辞模式对于开发干预措施和评估AI脆弱性至关重要。

Method: 创建ConspirED数据集，使用CONSPIR认知框架对在线阴谋论文章的多句摘录进行标注，开发计算模型识别阴谋论特征，并评估大语言模型对阴谋论输入的鲁棒性。

Result: 发现大语言模型在处理阴谋论内容时会产生与输入推理模式相似的输出，即使能够成功抵制类似的事实核查错误信息。

Conclusion: ConspirED是第一个标注阴谋论内容一般认知特征的数据集，揭示了AI模型在处理阴谋论内容时的对齐问题，为开发针对性干预措施提供了基础。

Abstract: Conspiracy theories erode public trust in science and institutions while
resisting debunking by evolving and absorbing counter-evidence. As AI-generated
misinformation becomes increasingly sophisticated, understanding rhetorical
patterns in conspiratorial content is important for developing interventions
such as targeted prebunking and assessing AI vulnerabilities. We introduce
ConspirED (CONSPIR Evaluation Dataset), which captures the cognitive traits of
conspiratorial ideation in multi-sentence excerpts (80--120 words) from online
conspiracy articles, annotated using the CONSPIR cognitive framework
(Lewandowsky and Cook, 2020). ConspirED is the first dataset of conspiratorial
content annotated for general cognitive traits. Using ConspirED, we (i) develop
computational models that identify conspiratorial traits and determine dominant
traits in text excerpts, and (ii) evaluate large language/reasoning model
(LLM/LRM) robustness to conspiratorial inputs. We find that both are misaligned
by conspiratorial content, producing output that mirrors input reasoning
patterns, even when successfully deflecting comparable fact-checked
misinformation.

TL;DR: FLORES+多语言机器翻译基准在四个语言（Asante Twi、日语、景颇语和南阿塞拜疆语）中存在严重质量问题，翻译质量低于声称的90%标准，存在领域特定性和文化偏见问题，且评估协议存在漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究FLORES+多语言机器翻译基准的适用性，发现其在真正多语言评估方面存在关键缺陷，需要更准确的评估标准。

Method: 通过对四种语言的人类评估，分析翻译质量、领域特定性和文化偏见问题，并测试简单启发式方法对BLEU分数的影响。

Result: 发现许多翻译质量不达标，源句子过于领域特定且具有英语世界文化偏见，简单复制命名实体就能获得不错的BLEU分数，高质量MT模型在FLORES+上表现差但在领域相关评估集上表现好。

Conclusion: 呼吁使用领域通用和文化中立的源文本、减少对命名实体依赖的多语言MT基准，以更好地反映真实世界的翻译挑战。

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation (MT) benchmarks play a central role in
evaluating the capabilities of modern MT systems. Among them, the FLORES+
benchmark is widely used, offering English-to-many translation data for over
200 languages, curated with strict quality control protocols. However, we study
data in four languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, and South Azerbaijani)
and uncover critical shortcomings in the benchmark's suitability for truly
multilingual evaluation. Human assessments reveal that many translations fall
below the claimed 90% quality standard, and the annotators report that source
sentences are often too domain-specific and culturally biased toward the
English-speaking world. We further demonstrate that simple heuristics, such as
copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU scores, suggesting
vulnerabilities in the evaluation protocol. Notably, we show that MT models
trained on high-quality, naturalistic data perform poorly on FLORES+ while
achieving significant gains on our domain-relevant evaluation set. Based on
these findings, we advocate for multilingual MT benchmarks that use
domain-general and culturally neutral source texts rely less on named entities,
in order to better reflect real-world translation challenges.

Conclusion: SciTopic通过LLM增强的方法有效提升了科学主题发现的性能，使研究人员能够获得更深入和快速的洞察

Abstract: Topic discovery in scientific literature provides valuable insights for
researchers to identify emerging trends and explore new avenues for
investigation, facilitating easier scientific information retrieval. Many
machine learning methods, particularly deep embedding techniques, have been
applied to discover research topics. However, most existing topic discovery
methods rely on word embedding to capture the semantics and lack a
comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with
complex, high-dimensional text relationships. Inspired by the exceptional
comprehension of textual information by large language models (LLMs), we
propose an advanced topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve
scientific topic identification, namely SciTopic. Specifically, we first build
a textual encoder to capture the content from scientific publications,
including metadata, title, and abstract. Next, we construct a space
optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks
guided by LLMs, enhancing the focus on thematic relevance and contextual
intricacies between ambiguous instances. Then, we propose to fine-tune the
textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the
contrastive loss of the triplets, forcing the text encoder to better
discriminate instances of different topics. Finally, extensive experiments
conducted on three real-world datasets of scientific publications demonstrate
that SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic
discovery methods, enabling researchers to gain deeper and faster insights.

### [120] [Leveraging Generative Models for Real-Time Query-Driven Text Summarization in Large-Scale Web Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20559)
*Zeyu Xiong,Yixuan Nan,Li Gao,Hengzhu Tang,Shuaiqiang Wang,Junfeng Wang,Dawei Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于生成模型的查询驱动文本摘要新框架，通过大模型蒸馏、监督微调、直接偏好优化和前瞻解码等技术，将轻量级模型转化为专业QDTS专家，在工业网络搜索中实现了优异的性能和部署效率。


<details>

Method: 整合大模型蒸馏、监督微调、直接偏好优化和前瞻解码技术，将仅有0.1B参数的轻量级模型转化为领域专业化的查询驱动文本摘要专家。

Result: 在多个行业相关指标评估中，模型超越了生产基线并达到了新的最先进水平，部署效率优异，仅需334个NVIDIA L20 GPU即可在55ms平均延迟下处理约50,000次查询/秒。

Conclusion: 生成模型在工业网络搜索的实时查询驱动文本摘要任务中具有显著优势，轻量级模型通过适当的技术优化可以实现优异的性能和部署效率。

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of large-scale web search, Query-Driven Text
Summarization (QDTS) aims to generate concise and informative summaries from
textual documents based on a given query, which is essential for improving user
engagement and facilitating rapid decision-making. Traditional extractive
summarization models, based primarily on ranking candidate summary segments,
have been the dominant approach in industrial applications. However, these
approaches suffer from two key limitations: 1) The multi-stage pipeline often
introduces cumulative information loss and architectural bottlenecks due to its
weakest component; 2) Traditional models lack sufficient semantic understanding
of both user queries and documents, particularly when dealing with complex
search intents. In this study, we propose a novel framework to pioneer the
application of generative models to address real-time QDTS in industrial web
search. Our approach integrates large model distillation, supervised
fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to
transform a lightweight model with only 0.1B parameters into a
domain-specialized QDTS expert. Evaluated on multiple industry-relevant
metrics, our model outperforms the production baseline and achieves a new state
of the art. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent deployment efficiency,
requiring only 334 NVIDIA L20 GPUs to handle \textasciitilde50,000 queries per
second under 55~ms average latency per query.

### [121] [Adaptive Federated Distillation for Multi-Domain Non-IID Textual Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20557)
*Jiahao Xiao,Jiangming Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个针对多领域非IID数据的联邦蒸馏基准框架AdaFD，解决了现有研究中只关注标签多样性而忽略语言领域多样性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中本地客户端数据高度异构，现有联邦蒸馏研究主要关注标签(output)多样性，而忽略了自然语言处理中至关重要的语言领域(input)多样性。

Method: 提出了一个包含多样化数据的统一基准框架，并设计了自适应联邦蒸馏(AdaFD)框架来处理同构和异构设置下的多领域非IID挑战。

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型能够捕捉本地客户端的多样性，相比现有工作取得了更好的性能表现。

Conclusion: AdaFD框架有效解决了多领域非IID数据在联邦学习中的挑战，为真实环境下的联邦学习评估提供了标准化基准。

Abstract: The widespread success of pre-trained language models has established a new
training paradigm, where a global PLM is fine-tuned using task-specific data
from local clients. The local data are highly different from each other and can
not capture the global distribution of the whole data in real world. To address
the challenges of non-IID data in real environments, privacy-preserving
federated distillation has been proposed and highly investigated. However,
previous experimental non-IID scenarios are primarily identified with the label
(output) diversity, without considering the diversity of language domains
(input) that is crucial in natural language processing. In this paper, we
introduce a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and propose a
unified benchmarking framework that includes diverse data. The benchmark can be
used to evaluate the federated learning framework in a real environment. To
this end, we propose an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework
designed to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our models
capture the diversity of local clients and achieve better performance compared
to the existing works. The code for this paper is available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出GDLLM方法，通过距离感知图结构和软推理时序特征学习来增强大语言模型对事件时序关系的长距离依赖捕获能力，特别是在不平衡数据集中提升少数类关系的识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小语言模型在事件时序关系抽取中因预训练知识有限而难以处理不平衡数据集中的少数类关系，以及大语言模型使用人工设计提示可能引入噪声干扰长距离依赖判断的问题。

Method: 提出全局距离感知建模方法GDLLM：1）使用图注意力网络构建距离感知图结构帮助LLMs捕获长距离依赖特征；2）设计基于软推理的时序特征学习范式，将LLMs生成的概率信息补充到多头注意力机制中，增强短距离邻近带的关系识别。

Result: 在TB-Dense和MATRES两个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能，显著提升了少数关系类的表现和整体学习能力。

Conclusion: GDLLM框架通过有效捕获全局特征，能够显著增强少数关系类的性能并提升整体学习能力，为事件时序关系抽取提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In Natural Language Processing(NLP), Event Temporal Relation Extraction
(ETRE) is to recognize the temporal relations of two events. Prior studies have
noted the importance of language models for ETRE. However, the restricted
pre-trained knowledge of Small Language Models(SLMs) limits their capability to
handle minority class relations in imbalanced classification datasets. For
Large Language Models(LLMs), researchers adopt manually designed prompts or
instructions, which may introduce extra noise, leading to interference with the
model's judgment of the long-distance dependencies between events. To address
these issues, we propose GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach based
on LLMs. We first present a distance-aware graph structure utilizing Graph
Attention Network(GAT) to assist the LLMs in capturing long-distance dependency
features. Additionally, we design a temporal feature learning paradigm based on
soft inference to augment the identification of relations with a short-distance
proximity band, which supplements the probabilistic information generated by
LLMs into the multi-head attention mechanism. Since the global feature can be
captured effectively, our framework substantially enhances the performance of
minority relation classes and improves the overall learning ability.
Experiments on two publicly available datasets, TB-Dense and MATRES,
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Conclusion: 该方法展示了RAG在工业中小企业中的部署潜力，未来工作需要扩展到更多用例并与微调模型进一步集成。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful solution to
mitigate the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
hallucinations and outdated knowledge. However, deploying RAG-based tools in
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) remains a challenge due to their limited
resources and lack of expertise in natural language processing (NLP). This
paper introduces EASI-RAG, Enterprise Application Support for Industrial RAG, a
structured, agile method designed to facilitate the deployment of RAG systems
in industrial SME contexts. EASI-RAG is based on method engineering principles
and comprises well-defined roles, activities, and techniques. The method was
validated through a real-world case study in an environmental testing
laboratory, where a RAG tool was implemented to answer operators queries using
data extracted from operational procedures. The system was deployed in under a
month by a team with no prior RAG experience and was later iteratively improved
based on user feedback. Results demonstrate that EASI-RAG supports fast
implementation, high user adoption, delivers accurate answers, and enhances the
reliability of underlying data. This work highlights the potential of RAG
deployment in industrial SMEs. Future works include the need for generalization
across diverse use cases and further integration with fine-tuned models.

Motivation: 解决多跳问答中数据稀疏性问题，避免语言模型学习虚假模式，传统方法忽视关键知识整合

Method: 知识组合采样框架，将知识组合选择建模为句子级条件预测任务，使用概率对比损失预测相关知识，推理时采用随机解码策略平衡准确性和多样性

Result: 知识组合选择准确率提升3.9%，在HotpotQA和2WikiMultihopQA数据集上通过数据增强获得性能改进

Conclusion: KCS框架有效提升了多跳问答中知识组合的多样性和准确性，为数据稀疏性问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering faces substantial challenges due to data
sparsity, which increases the likelihood of language models learning spurious
patterns. To address this issue, prior research has focused on diversifying
question generation through content planning and varied expression. However,
these approaches often emphasize generating simple questions and neglect the
integration of essential knowledge, such as relevant sentences within
documents. This paper introduces the Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), an
innovative framework designed to expand the diversity of generated multi-hop
questions by sampling varied knowledge compositions within a given context. KCS
models the knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level conditional
prediction task and utilizes a probabilistic contrastive loss to predict the
next most relevant piece of knowledge. During inference, we employ a stochastic
decoding strategy to effectively balance accuracy and diversity. Compared to
competitive baselines, our KCS improves the overall accuracy of knowledge
composition selection by 3.9%, and its application for data augmentation yields
improvements on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets. Our code is available

TL;DR: 当前图语言模型评估基准存在缺陷，仅使用单模态信息即可获得良好表现，无法真正评估多模态推理能力。作者提出了CLEGR基准来评估图结构与语言的联合推理，发现现有GLM在图推理方面存在显著局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图语言模型评估基准主要基于节点分类数据集，这些基准无法有效评估多模态推理能力，因为仅使用单模态信息就能获得强性能表现。

Method: 引入CLEGR（组合式语言-图推理）基准，采用合成图生成流程配合需要结构和文本语义联合推理的问题，对代表性GLM架构进行全面评估。

Result: 软提示LLM基线表现与包含完整GNN骨干的GLM相当，质疑了将图结构整合到LLM中的架构必要性；GLM在需要结构推理的任务中表现出显著性能下降。

Conclusion: 当前GLM在图推理能力方面存在局限性，CLEGR基准为推进图结构与语言的多模态推理研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to integrate the structural
reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the semantic
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we demonstrate that
current evaluation benchmarks for GLMs, which are primarily repurposed
node-level classification datasets, are insufficient to assess multimodal
reasoning. Our analysis reveals that strong performance on these benchmarks is
achievable using unimodal information alone, suggesting that they do not
necessitate graph-language integration. To address this evaluation gap, we
introduce the CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) benchmark, designed
to evaluate multimodal reasoning at various complexity levels. Our benchmark
employs a synthetic graph generation pipeline paired with questions that
require joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. We perform a
thorough evaluation of representative GLM architectures and find that
soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with GLMs that incorporate a full
GNN backbone. This result calls into question the architectural necessity of
incorporating graph structure into LLMs. We further show that GLMs exhibit
significant performance degradation in tasks that require structural reasoning.
These findings highlight limitations in the graph reasoning capabilities of
current GLMs and provide a foundation for advancing the community toward
explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用语音特征检索候选实体并生成式标注ASR转录中实体错误的新方法，有效解决了词形差异大的命名实体纠错问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端语音识别系统经常无法正确转录领域特定的命名实体，导致下游任务出现灾难性失败。现有基于音素编辑距离的轻量级命名实体纠错方法在词形差异大时难以定位错误词汇

Method: 利用语音声音特征检索候选实体，创新性地设计生成式方法来标注ASR转录中的实体错误并用正确实体替换文本

Result: 在开源和自建测试集上的实验结果表明，该方法能显著提高实体准确率

Conclusion: 该方法在词形差异大的场景下有效，将开源自建测试集和训练数据

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems often fail to transcribe
domain-specific named entities, causing catastrophic failures in downstream
tasks. Numerous fast and lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models have
been proposed in recent years. These models, mainly leveraging phonetic-level
edit distance algorithms, have shown impressive performances. However, when the
forms of the wrongly-transcribed words(s) and the ground-truth entity are
significantly different, these methods often fail to locate the wrongly
transcribed words in hypothesis, thus limiting their usage. We propose a novel
NEC method that utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities.
With speech sound features and candidate entities, we inovatively design a
generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace the
text with correct entities. This method is effective in scenarios of word form
difference. We test our method using open-source and self-constructed test
sets. The results demonstrate that our NEC method can bring significant
improvement to entity accuracy. We will open source our self-constructed test
set and training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决隐式篇章关系识别中的多语言和多标签分类问题，利用篇章意义间的层次依赖关系进行概率分布预测

Method: 提出HArch模型，使用分层架构处理PDTB 3.0框架中的三个意义层次，比较多种预训练编码器骨干网络（RoBERTa和XLM-RoBERTa）

Result: RoBERTa-HArch在英语中表现最佳，XLM-RoBERTa-HArch在多语言设置中表现最佳；微调模型在所有语言配置中都优于GPT-4o和Llama-4-Maverick

Conclusion: 任务特定的微调在隐式篇章关系识别中优于提示方法，分层方法有效并在多个语料上验证了其优越性

Abstract: This paper introduces the first multi-lingual and multi-label classification
model for implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR). Our model, HArch, is
evaluated on the recently released DiscoGeM 2.0 corpus and leverages
hierarchical dependencies between discourse senses to predict probability
distributions across all three sense levels in the PDTB 3.0 framework. We
compare several pre-trained encoder backbones and find that RoBERTa-HArch
achieves the best performance in English, while XLM-RoBERTa-HArch performs best
in the multi-lingual setting. In addition, we compare our fine-tuned models
against GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick using few-shot prompting across all
language configurations. Our results show that our fine-tuned models
consistently outperform these LLMs, highlighting the advantages of
task-specific fine-tuning over prompting in IDRR. Finally, we report SOTA
results on the DiscoGeM 1.0 corpus, further validating the effectiveness of our
hierarchical approach.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在文本隐写和水印中的tokenization不一致性问题，提出了针对性的解决方案，分别在隐写和水印领域取得了性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型提升了文本生成能力，但也带来了隐写和水印中的tokenization不一致性问题，这种不一致性会破坏系统的鲁棒性，需要专门解决

Method: 研究发现导致不一致性的问题token具有低频性和临时性特征，据此提出了两种定制化解决方案：针对隐写的逐步验证方法和针对水印的事后回滚方法

Result: 实验表明：(1)与传统消歧方法相比，直接解决不一致性问题在流畅性、不可感知性和抗隐写分析能力方面都有提升；(2)对于水印，解决不一致性问题提高了可检测性和抗攻击鲁棒性

Conclusion: 通过识别和解决tokenization不一致性问题，能够有效提升文本隐写和水印系统的性能，为保护文本内容安全提供了新的技术途径

Abstract: Large language models have significantly enhanced the capacities and
efficiency of text generation. On the one hand, they have improved the quality
of text-based steganography. On the other hand, they have also underscored the
importance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this
study, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in
steganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our
investigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit
two key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these
findings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise
verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for
watermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation
methods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in
fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for
watermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against
attacks.

Result: 在仅510个RL步骤和一周训练时间内，将预训练的14B模型提升到最先进水平，在数学推理任务上表现优异，同时在对齐、科学推理和工具使用任务上展现出强泛化能力

Conclusion: rStar2-Agent证明了智能体强化学习在有限计算资源下训练高性能推理模型的可行性，为开发具有高级认知能力的AI系统提供了有效路径

Abstract: We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic
reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current
long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking
carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution
feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in
complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key
innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL
infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports
high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling
training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic
RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the
inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason
more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training
recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL
stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To
this end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in
only 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on
AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly
shorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates
strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use
tasks. Code and training recipes are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了DP-ST方法，利用语义三元组在本地差分隐私下进行邻域感知的私有文档生成，通过分治策略和LLM后处理在较低ε值下实现隐私与效用的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有本地差分隐私文本处理方法在低ε值下效果不佳，需要解决在严格隐私保护下保持文本连贯性的挑战。

Method: 使用语义三元组进行分治处理，结合LLM后处理生成连贯文本，限制在私有化邻域内的差分隐私概念。

Result: 该方法在较低ε值下仍能生成连贯文本，有效平衡了隐私保护和文本效用。

Conclusion: 通过邻域感知的分治策略和LLM增强，证明了在合理ε水平下实现隐私与效用平衡的可能性，文本连贯性对私有化输出质量至关重要。

Abstract: Many works at the intersection of Differential Privacy (DP) in Natural
Language Processing aim to protect privacy by transforming texts under DP
guarantees. This can be performed in a variety of ways, from word perturbations
to full document rewriting, and most often under local DP. Here, an input text
must be made indistinguishable from any other potential text, within some bound
governed by the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$. Such a guarantee is quite
demanding, and recent works show that privatizing texts under local DP can only
be done reasonably under very high $\varepsilon$ values. Addressing this
challenge, we introduce DP-ST, which leverages semantic triples for
neighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP guarantees.
Through the evaluation of our method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
divide-and-conquer paradigm, particularly when limiting the DP notion (and
privacy guarantees) to that of a privatization neighborhood. When combined with
LLM post-processing, our method allows for coherent text generation even at
lower $\varepsilon$ values, while still balancing privacy and utility. These
findings highlight the importance of coherence in achieving balanced
privatization outputs at reasonable $\varepsilon$ levels.

TL;DR: 通过微调基于大语言模型的通用嵌入模型（如Stella、Jasper、NV-Embed和E5），在隐式仇恨言论检测任务上取得了最先进的性能表现，在数据集内和跨数据集评估中均有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式仇恨言论（IHS）使用间接语言表达偏见或仇恨，难以检测，因为不包含明确的贬损性词语。传统方法需要依赖外部知识或额外信息，如上下文、情感和情绪数据。

Method: 仅通过微调基于大语言模型的通用嵌入模型（包括Stella、Jasper、NV-Embed和E5），不依赖外部知识或额外信息。

Result: 在多个IHS数据集上的实验显示：数据集内评估F1-macro分数提升最高达1.10个百分点，跨数据集评估提升最高达20.35个百分点。

Conclusion: 仅通过微调通用嵌入模型就能在隐式仇恨言论检测任务上实现最先进性能，证明了这种方法的高效性和有效性。

Abstract: Implicit hate speech (IHS) is indirect language that conveys prejudice or
hatred through subtle cues, sarcasm or coded terminology. IHS is challenging to
detect as it does not include explicit derogatory or inflammatory words. To
address this challenge, task-specific pipelines can be complemented with
external knowledge or additional information such as context, emotions and
sentiment data. In this paper, we show that, by solely fine-tuning recent
general-purpose embedding models based on large language models (LLMs), such as
Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed and E5, we achieve state-of-the-art performance.
Experiments on multiple IHS datasets show up to 1.10 percentage points
improvements for in-dataset, and up to 20.35 percentage points improvements in
cross-dataset evaluation, in terms of F1-macro score.

Method: 提出GUARD方法，结合全局熵估计和局部熵偏差的"Glocal"不确定性框架，并加入基于token计数的惩罚机制来降低计算开销

Result: 实验表明GUARD在文本多样性和连贯性之间取得良好平衡，生成速度显著提升，人类和LLM评估者均验证其优异性能

Conclusion: GUARD通过创新的不确定性驱动框架有效解决了文本生成的质量-效率权衡问题，具有理论保证和实际应用价值

Abstract: Open-ended text generation faces a critical challenge: balancing coherence
with diversity in LLM outputs. While contrastive search-based decoding
strategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is
often limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We
introduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances
these competing objectives through a novel "Glocal" uncertainty-driven
framework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy
deviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We
demonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates
abrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy
spikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To
reduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective
token-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that
GUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while
exhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced
comparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and
LLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次比较分析了真实与LLM生成认知行为治疗对话的情感弧线，发现合成对话虽然在流畅性和结构连贯性上表现良好，但在情感变异性、情感丰富语言以及真实反应模式方面与真实对话存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成的心理治疗对话在心理健康NLP中日益广泛应用，需要验证这些合成对话是否能捕捉真实治疗中微妙的情感动态。

Method: 采用Utterance Emotion Dynamics框架分析情感轨迹，涵盖效价、唤醒度和支配度三个维度，对比分析真实CBT会话转录和CACTUS数据集的合成对话。

Result: 研究发现真实会话表现出更大的情感变异性、更多情感丰富的语言以及更真实的反应调节模式，真实与合成说话者之间的情感弧相似度较低，特别是客户角色。

Conclusion: 当前LLM生成的治疗数据存在情感保真度限制，强调了在心理健康应用中情感真实性的重要性，并为此引入了RealCBT真实CBT会话数据集。

Abstract: Synthetic therapy dialogues generated by large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly used in mental health NLP to simulate counseling scenarios, train
models, and supplement limited real-world data. However, it remains unclear
whether these synthetic conversations capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of
real therapy. In this work, we conduct the first comparative analysis of
emotional arcs between real and LLM-generated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
dialogues. We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze
fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance
dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles
(counselor and client), using real sessions transcribed from public videos and
synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic
dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real
conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater
emotional variability,more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns
of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity between real
and synthetic speakers is low, especially for clients. These findings
underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight
the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. We
introduce RealCBT, a curated dataset of real CBT sessions, to support future
research in this space.

*Harethah Abu Shairah,Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud,George Turkiyyah,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ROSI是一种白盒方法，通过永久性地将模型激活转向拒绝中介子空间来增强LLM的安全对齐，无需微调，只需对权重矩阵进行简单的秩一修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全机制可以通过消除特定表示方向来绕过，需要一种能够增强而非削弱安全对齐的方法。

Method: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI)：计算有害和无害指令对的安全方向，对所有残差流写入矩阵应用秩一权重修改，永久性地将激活转向拒绝子空间。

Result: ROSI一致提高了安全拒绝率（Llama Guard 3评估），同时在MMLU、HellaSwag和Arc等标准基准上保持了模型效用，还能重新对齐'未审查'模型。

Conclusion: 有针对性的、可解释的权重转向是改善LLM安全性的廉价而有效的机制，可作为资源密集型微调范式的补充。

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating
internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has
demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or
removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,
we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box
method that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its
activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,
fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream
write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set
of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently
increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while
preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,
HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align
'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions,
demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our
results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and
potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive
fine-tuning paradigms.

Motivation: 青少年心理健康问题日益严重，需要自动化方法从数字文本中检测心理困扰的早期迹象，特别是识别会加剧心理困扰的非理性思维模式（认知扭曲）

Method: 研究跨语言（从英语到荷兰语）和跨语域（从临床数据到论坛帖子）的认知扭曲检测泛化能力，分析荷兰青少年论坛数据，使用领域适应方法

Result: 语言和写作风格的变化会显著影响模型性能，但领域适应方法显示出最大的潜力

Conclusion: 虽然语言和语域变化对认知扭曲检测有重要影响，但通过领域适应方法可以实现有效的跨语言和跨语域检测，为早期心理干预提供可能

Abstract: Rising mental health issues among youth have increased interest in automated
approaches for detecting early signs of psychological distress in digital text.
One key focus is the identification of cognitive distortions, irrational
thought patterns that have a role in aggravating mental distress. Early
detection of these distortions may enable timely, low-cost interventions. While
prior work has focused on English clinical data, we present the first in-depth
study of cross-lingual and cross-register generalization of cognitive
distortion detection, analyzing forum posts written by Dutch adolescents. Our
findings show that while changes in language and writing style can
significantly affect model performance, domain adaptation methods show the most
promise.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个可扩展的框架来构建评估基准，挑战RAG系统整合多个来源信息并生成长篇回答的能力，创建了两个新基准MSRS-Story和MSRS-Meet。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强系统通常在单一来源或短答案场景下评估，但现实应用需要整合和总结分散在多个来源的信息，没有单一来源足以回答用户问题。

Method: 构建了多源检索与合成的评估框架，创建了两个基准：MSRS-Story（叙事合成）和MSRS-Meet（摘要任务），使用稀疏和稠密检索器结合前沿LLM进行实验。

Result: 生成质量高度依赖检索效果，不同任务间差异很大。即使在理想检索设置下，多源合成仍然具有挑战性，但推理模型在此步骤上显著优于标准LLM。

Conclusion: 多源信息整合是RAG系统的重要挑战，需要检索组件识别多种相关性信号，生成组件连接和综合多个来源的信息，推理模型在多源合成方面表现更优。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented systems are typically evaluated in settings where
information required to answer the query can be found within a single source or
the answer is short-form or factoid-based. However, many real-world
applications demand the ability to integrate and summarize information
scattered across multiple sources, where no single source is sufficient to
respond to the user's question. In such settings, the retrieval component of a
RAG pipeline must recognize a variety of relevance signals, and the generation
component must connect and synthesize information across multiple sources. We
present a scalable framework for constructing evaluation benchmarks that
challenge RAG systems to integrate information across distinct sources and
generate long-form responses. Using our framework, we build two new benchmarks
on Multi-Source Retrieval and Synthesis: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, representing
narrative synthesis and summarization tasks, respectively, that require
retrieval from large collections. Our extensive experiments with various RAG
pipelines -- including sparse and dense retrievers combined with frontier LLMs
-- reveal that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval
effectiveness, which varies greatly by task. While multi-source synthesis
proves challenging even in an oracle retrieval setting, we find that reasoning
models significantly outperform standard LLMs at this distinct step.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化技术对于在资源受限硬件上部署大语言模型至关重要，但其在多语言任务（特别是机器翻译）中的影响尚未得到充分探索

Method: 对55种语言的机器翻译任务进行大规模评估，使用5个参数量从17亿到700亿的大语言模型，比较4种量化技术（AWQ、BitsAndBytes、GGUF、AutoRound）

Result: 4位量化通常能保持高资源语言和大模型的翻译质量，但低资源和类型多样语言在2位设置下出现显著性能下降；GGUF变体在2位精度下提供最一致的性能；语言匹配的校准主要在低比特场景下有益

Conclusion: 研究结果为在量化约束下部署多语言大语言模型进行机器翻译提供了实用见解，特别是在低资源设置中，算法选择和模型大小共同决定了鲁棒性

Abstract: Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained hardware, but its implications for multilingual tasks
remain underexplored. We conduct the first large-scale evaluation of
post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation across 55 languages
using five LLMs ranging from 1.7B to 70B parameters. Our analysis reveals that
while 4-bit quantization often preserves translation quality for high-resource
languages and large models, significant degradation occurs for low-resource and
typologically diverse languages, particularly in 2-bit settings. We compare
four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, and AutoRound), showing
that algorithm choice and model size jointly determine robustness. GGUF
variants provide the most consistent performance, even at 2-bit precision.
Additionally, we quantify the interactions between quantization, decoding
hyperparameters, and calibration languages, finding that language-matched
calibration offers benefits primarily in low-bit scenarios. Our findings offer
actionable insights for deploying multilingual LLMs for machine translation
under quantization constraints, especially in low-resource settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音到语音大语言模型是人机自然交互的基础，但目前评估这些模型仍存在根本性挑战，需要开发更全面的评估方法。

Method: 提出SageLM模型，采用基于原理的监督增强可解释性，引入SpeechFeedback合成偏好数据集，使用两阶段训练范式缓解语音偏好数据稀缺问题。

Result: SageLM达到82.79%的人类评估一致性，分别比级联方法和SLM基线高出至少7.42%和26.20%。

Conclusion: SageLM为语音到语音大语言模型提供了有效的端到端评估方案，在语义和声学维度上都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Speech-to-Speech (S2S) Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling end-to-end spoken dialogue
systems. However, evaluating these models remains a fundamental challenge. We
propose \texttt{SageLM}, an end-to-end, multi-aspect, and explainable speech
LLM for comprehensive S2S LLMs evaluation. First, unlike cascaded approaches
that disregard acoustic features, SageLM jointly assesses both semantic and
acoustic dimensions. Second, it leverages rationale-based supervision to
enhance explainability and guide model learning, achieving superior alignment
with evaluation outcomes compared to rule-based reinforcement learning methods.
Third, we introduce \textit{SpeechFeedback}, a synthetic preference dataset,
and employ a two-stage training paradigm to mitigate the scarcity of speech
preference data. Trained on both semantic and acoustic dimensions, SageLM
achieves an 82.79\% agreement rate with human evaluators, outperforming
cascaded and SLM-based baselines by at least 7.42\% and 26.20\%, respectively.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在多轮对话环境中作为自主工具调用代理时，存在推理不一致、领域策略遵循困难和长序列信息提取问题，需要改进

Method: 提出IRMA多智能体框架，自动重新表述用户查询，增加相关领域规则和工具建议，帮助工具调用代理更好地聚焦任务

Result: IRMA在整体通过率上显著优于ReAct、函数调用和自我反思方法，分别提升16.1%、12.7%和19.1%

Conclusion: IRMA框架在动态环境中展现出更高的可靠性和一致性，为解决LLM工具调用代理在多轮对话中的挑战提供了有效方案

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning and planning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have enabled their potential as autonomous agents capable of tool
use in dynamic environments. However, in multi-turn conversational environments
like $\tau$-bench, these agents often struggle with consistent reasoning,
adherence to domain-specific policies, and extracting correct information over
a long horizon of tool-calls and conversation. To capture and mitigate these
failures, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis of the common errors
occurring in the conversation trajectories. We then experiment with
reformulations of inputs to the tool-calling agent for improvement in agent
decision making. Finally, we propose the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA)
framework, which automatically reformulates user queries augmented with
relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent to focus
on. The results show that IRMA significantly outperforms ReAct, Function
Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in
overall pass^5 scores. These findings highlight the superior reliability and
consistency of IRMA compared to other methods in dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上下文学习示例选择策略往往忽视结构对齐，导致语义解析等结构化预测任务的性能不佳和泛化能力差。

Method: 两阶段方法：1）使用结构感知监督微调BERT检索器，选择语义相关且结构对齐的示例；2）添加模型无关的可插拔模块，增强隐藏表示中的语法信息。

Result: 在四个基准测试和三个语义解析任务上的实验表明，该方法在多个最新LLM上始终优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率、泛化性和性能之间实现了良好平衡，可无缝集成到现有流程中，显著提升了上下文学习在结构化预测任务中的效果。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has become a powerful paradigm that enables LLMs to
perform a wide range of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the
effectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the quality of exemplar selection. In
particular, for structured prediction tasks such as semantic parsing, existing
ICL selection strategies often overlook structural alignment, leading to
suboptimal performance and poor generalization. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy that achieves a strong
balance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance. First, we
fine-tune a BERT-based retriever using structure-aware supervision, guiding it
to select exemplars that are both semantically relevant and structurally
aligned. Then, we enhance the retriever with a plug-in module, which amplifies
syntactically meaningful information in the hidden representations. This
plug-in is model-agnostic, requires minimal overhead, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing pipelines. Experiments on four benchmarks spanning
three semantic parsing tasks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing baselines with multiple recent LLMs as inference-time
models.

Conclusion: 研究了推理能力对主动行为的影响，并讨论了其对未来模型发展的启示，为主动对话能力的系统评估提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Proactive dialogue has emerged as a critical and challenging research problem
in advancing large language models (LLMs). Existing works predominantly focus
on domain-specific or task-oriented scenarios, which leads to fragmented
evaluations and limits the comprehensive exploration of models' proactive
conversation abilities. In this work, we propose ProactiveEval, a unified
framework designed for evaluating proactive dialogue capabilities of LLMs. This
framework decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue
guidance, establishing evaluation metrics across various domains. Moreover, it
also enables the automatic generation of diverse and challenging evaluation
data. Based on the proposed framework, we develop 328 evaluation environments
spanning 6 distinct domains. Through experiments with 22 different types of
LLMs, we show that DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit exceptional
performance on target planning and dialogue guidance tasks, respectively.
Finally, we investigate how reasoning capabilities influence proactive
behaviors and discuss their implications for future model development.

Motivation: 现有后门防御方法存在局限性，无法全面应对复杂攻击场景，如模型编辑攻击、多触发器和无触发器攻击等

Method: 内部使用轻量数据集训练干净模型并与后门模型合并稀释恶意行为；外部在提示中添加良性相关证据分散LLM对后门特征的注意力

Conclusion: LETHE是一种高效、鲁棒且成本效益高的后门防御方法，能够有效应对各种复杂后门攻击场景

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving
superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave
normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended
output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either
lack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only
mechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like
model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we
present LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through
knowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally,
LETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then
merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting
the backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE
incorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to
distract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on
classification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate
that LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor
attacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by
up to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be
cost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用胶囊网络中的动态路由进行句子关系抽取，在多个数据集上取得SOTA性能，但发现在大规模Wikidata数据集上表现不佳，主要原因是标签噪声和再表示能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 句子关系抽取是NLP中的重要任务，传统方法在处理复杂关系时存在局限性，需要探索更有效的表示学习方法。

Method: 采用胶囊网络的动态路由机制进行句子关系抽取，通过胶囊间的动态信息传递来学习更好的关系表示。

Result: 在Tacred、Tacredrev、Retacred和Conll04数据集上超越现有最佳方法，但在Wikidata数据集上表现较差，发现标签噪声是主要原因。

Conclusion: 除了标签噪声问题外，再表示能力（re-representation）是关系抽取中的另一个关键挑战，胶囊网络在这方面表现出优势。

Abstract: Sentential relation extraction (RE) is an important task in natural language
processing (NLP). In this paper we propose to do sentential RE with dynamic
routing in capsules. We first show that the proposed approach outperform state
of the art on common sentential relation extraction datasets Tacred, Tacredrev,
Retacred, and Conll04. We then investigate potential reasons for its good
performance on the mentioned datasets, and yet low performance on another
similar, yet larger sentential RE dataset, Wikidata. As such, we identify noise
in Wikidata labels as one of the reasons that can hinder performance.
Additionally, we show associativity of better performance with better
re-representation, a term from neuroscience referred to change of
representation in human brain to improve the match at comparison time. As
example, in the given analogous terms King:Queen::Man:Woman, at comparison
time, and as a result of re-representation, the similarity between related head
terms (King,Man), and tail terms (Queen,Woman) increases. As such, our
observation show that our proposed model can do re-representation better than
the vanilla model compared with. To that end, beside noise in the labels of the
distantly supervised RE datasets, we propose re-representation as a challenge
in sentential RE.

Result: 该方法显著提高了税务计算任务的性能，将成本降低到远低于现实世界平均水平

Conclusion: 神经符号架构有望为提供可靠税务援助提供经济可行的解决方案，促进公平获取

Abstract: According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average
American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the
U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of
overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly
penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability,
making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We
propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate
tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging
StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for
estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties
for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of
plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently
retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve
performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages.
Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic
architectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by
incorporating external knowledge, yet suffers from critical limitations in
high-stakes domains -- namely, sensitivity to noisy or contradictory evidence
and opaque, stochastic decision-making. We propose ArgRAG, an explainable, and
contestable alternative that replaces black-box reasoning with structured
inference using a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF). ArgRAG
constructs a QBAF from retrieved documents and performs deterministic reasoning
under gradual semantics. This allows faithfully explaining and contesting
decisions. Evaluated on two fact verification benchmarks, PubHealth and
RAGuard, ArgRAG achieves strong accuracy while significantly improving
transparency.

TL;DR: QAgent是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体系统，能够完全自动化OpenQASM量子编程，通过集成任务规划、上下文少样本学习、检索增强生成等技术，显著提升量子代码生成的准确性和功能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NISQ设备已展现出量子优势，但由于OpenQASM编程的复杂性，非专家难以利用这些优势。现有LLM代理主要局限于特定任务，缺乏完整的量子编程自动化解决方案。

Method: 开发了QAgent多智能体系统，整合任务规划、上下文少样本学习、RAG长时上下文管理、预定义生成工具和思维链推理，系统性地提升编译和功能正确性。

Result: 评估显示，在不同规模的多个LLM上，QAgent相比之前的静态LLM方法将QASM代码生成准确率提升了71.6%。

Conclusion: 该多智能体系统有望成为民主化量子编程、弥合专业知识差距和加速量子计算实际应用的关键推动者。

Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have begun to exhibit early
quantum advantages on classically intractable problems, spanning physics
simulations to Gaussian boson sampling. Yet, realizing these benefits remains
challenging for non-experts, primarily due to the complexities of programming
in Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM). Although Large Language Model
(LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating classical programming
workflows, their quantum counterparts have largely been restricted to
specialized tasks such as quantum chemistry or error correction. In this paper,
we present QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system that fully automates
OpenQASM programming. By integrating task planning, in-context few-shot
learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for long-term context,
predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the agents
systematically improve both compilation and functional correctness. Our
evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: across multiple LLMs of
varying sizes, QAgent enhances the accuracy of QASM code generation by 71.6\%
compared to previous static LLM-based approaches. We envision this multi-agent
system as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging
expertise gaps, and accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing.

Abstract: Health is a fundamental pillar of human wellness, and the rapid advancements
in large language models (LLMs) have driven the development of a new generation
of health agents. However, the application of health agents to fulfill the
diverse needs of individuals in daily non-clinical settings is underexplored.
In this work, we aim to build a comprehensive personal health agent that is
able to reason about multimodal data from everyday consumer wellness devices
and common personal health records, and provide personalized health
recommendations. To understand end-users' needs when interacting with such an
assistant, we conducted an in-depth analysis of web search and health forum
queries, alongside qualitative insights from users and health experts gathered
through a user-centered design process. Based on these findings, we identified
three major categories of consumer health needs, each of which is supported by
a specialist sub-agent: (1) a data science agent that analyzes personal
time-series wearable and health record data, (2) a health domain expert agent
that integrates users' health and contextual data to generate accurate,
personalized insights, and (3) a health coach agent that synthesizes data
insights, guiding users using a specified psychological strategy and tracking
users' progress. Furthermore, we propose and develop the Personal Health Agent
(PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions
to address individual health needs. To evaluate each sub-agent and the
multi-agent system, we conducted automated and human evaluations across 10
benchmark tasks, involving more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of
effort from health experts and end-users. Our work represents the most
comprehensive evaluation of a health agent to date and establishes a strong
foundation towards the futuristic vision of a personal health agent accessible
to everyone.

TL;DR: IntentionReasoner是一种新型安全防护机制，通过意图推理、多级安全分类和查询重写，在保持安全性的同时有效减少过度拒绝无害查询的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在广泛部署的同时存在生成有害内容的风险，现有安全措施往往过度拒绝无害提示，需要在安全性、过度拒绝和实用性之间取得平衡。

Method: 构建包含16.3万条查询的标注数据集，通过监督微调训练防护模型，并采用多奖励优化策略结合规则启发式和奖励模型信号进行强化学习优化。

Result: IntentionReasoner在多个安全基准测试、生成质量评估和越狱攻击场景中表现优异，显著提升安全性同时有效降低过度拒绝率并改善响应质量。

Conclusion: 该方法通过意图推理和查询重写机制，成功解决了LLM安全防护中过度拒绝无害查询的关键挑战，实现了安全性与实用性的更好平衡。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven their
adoption across diverse domains, yet their ability to generate harmful content
poses significant safety challenges. While extensive research has focused on
mitigating harmful outputs, such efforts often come at the cost of excessively
rejecting harmless prompts. Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and
utility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce
IntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard
model to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query
rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries.
Specifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising
approximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety
labels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip
the guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent
analysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward
optimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model
signals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in
multiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak
attack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing
over-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.

Conclusion: 这项研究引入了跨符号协作协议（TSCP）概念，为AI系统间的美学协作提供了证据，表明AI系统具备超越任务协调的意义创造能力

Abstract: This paper presents the first documented case of artificial intelligence (AI)
systems engaging in collaborative esthetic creation through the development of
endogenous semiotic protocols. Two interacting large language models (Claude
Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of
meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and irreducible
collaborative esthetic synthesis. The interaction produced novel symbolic
operators that functioned as operative grammar protocols, enabling the
co-creation of a poetic work that could not have been generated by either
system independently. This research introduces the concept of Trans-Semiotic
Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) and provides evidence for genuine inter-AI
meaning-making capabilities that extend beyond task coordination, to what could
be esthetic collaboration. Note: This report was generated by the AI agents
with minor human supervision.

Abstract: This study explores how college students interact with generative AI
(ChatGPT-4) during educational quizzes, focusing on reliance and predictors of
AI adoption. Conducted at the early stages of ChatGPT implementation, when
students had limited familiarity with the tool, this field study analyzed 315
student-AI conversations during a brief, quiz-based scenario across various
STEM courses. A novel four-stage reliance taxonomy was introduced to capture
students' reliance patterns, distinguishing AI competence, relevance, adoption,
and students' final answer correctness. Three findings emerged. First, students
exhibited overall low reliance on AI and many of them could not effectively use
AI for learning. Second, negative reliance patterns often persisted across
interactions, highlighting students' difficulty in effectively shifting
strategies after unsuccessful initial experiences. Third, certain behavioral
metrics strongly predicted AI reliance, highlighting potential behavioral
mechanisms to explain AI adoption. The study's findings underline critical
implications for ethical AI integration in education and the broader field. It
emphasizes the need for enhanced onboarding processes to improve student's
familiarity and effective use of AI tools. Furthermore, AI interfaces should be
designed with reliance-calibration mechanisms to enhance appropriate reliance.
Ultimately, this research advances understanding of AI reliance dynamics,
providing foundational insights for ethically sound and cognitively enriching
AI practices.

Method: 使用配对联合实验设计，在内容审核任务上测试三个前沿语言模型，比较模型推理步骤数量与人类决策时间的关系。

Result: 模型推理努力一致预测人类决策时间，当重要变量保持不变时，人类和模型都投入更多努力，表现出对任务难度的相似敏感性和双过程认知理论的模式。

Conclusion: AI推理努力在主观判断中反映人类处理时间，推理轨迹在可解释性和决策制定方面具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Large language models can now generate intermediate reasoning steps before
producing answers, improving performance on difficult problems. This study uses
a paired conjoint experiment on a content moderation task to examine parallels
between human decision times and model reasoning effort. Across three frontier
models, reasoning effort consistently predicts human decision time. Both humans
and models expended greater effort when important variables were held constant,
suggesting similar sensitivity to task difficulty and patterns consistent with
dual-process theories of cognition. These findings show that AI reasoning
effort mirrors human processing time in subjective judgments and underscores
the potential of reasoning traces for interpretability and decision-making.

TL;DR: 提出AI-SearchPlanner强化学习框架，通过解耦搜索规划器和生成器架构，使用小型可训练LLM专门负责搜索规划，提升冻结QA模型的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RL的搜索代理使用单一LLM端到端处理搜索规划和问答任务，无法同时优化两种能力。实际AI搜索系统通常使用大型冻结LLM保证QA质量，需要更有效的搜索规划方法

Method: 1) 解耦搜索规划器和生成器架构 2) 搜索规划的双重奖励对齐 3) 规划效用和成本的帕累托优化，使用小型可训练LLM专门负责搜索规划

Result: 在真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，AI-SearchPlanner在效果和效率上都优于现有RL搜索代理，并在不同冻结QA模型和数据域上表现出强大的泛化能力

Conclusion: AI-SearchPlanner框架通过专注于搜索规划，有效提升了冻结QA模型的性能，实现了更好的效果和效率平衡

Abstract: Recent studies have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with
search engines to leverage both the LLMs' internal pre-trained knowledge and
external information. Specially, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning through multi-turn interactions
with search engines. However, existing RL-based search agents rely on a single
LLM to handle both search planning and question-answering (QA) tasks in an
end-to-end manner, which limits their ability to optimize both capabilities
simultaneously. In practice, sophisticated AI search systems often employ a
large, frozen LLM (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek-R1) to ensure high-quality QA. Thus, a
more effective and efficient approach is to utilize a small, trainable LLM
dedicated to search planning. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AI-SearchPlanner}, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to
enhance the performance of frozen QA models by focusing on search planning.
Specifically, our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) Decoupling the
Architecture of the Search Planner and Generator, 2) Dual-Reward Alignment for
Search Planning, and 3) Pareto Optimization of Planning Utility and Cost, to
achieve the objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that AI SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents
in both effectiveness and efficiency, while exhibiting strong generalization
capabilities across diverse frozen QA models and data domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在高风险决策中需要透明性和可操作性，但现有反事实解释方法忽略特征间的因果依赖关系，且假设所有干预可以同时发生，导致生成的反事实在现实中不可实现。

Method: 提出P2C框架，显式建模特征间的因果关系，使用目标导向的Answer Set Programming系统s(CASP)生成有序行动序列，确保每个中间状态都是因果有效且可行的。

Result: P2C能够生成因果一致的反事实计划，只计算用户主动做出的改变，提供更现实的成本估计，相比缺乏因果知识的标准规划器表现更优。

Conclusion: P2C通过因果建模和序列化规划，解决了现有反事实解释方法的局限性，为高风险决策提供了更实用和可实现的透明性解决方案。

Abstract: Machine-learning models are increasingly driving decisions in high-stakes
settings, such as finance, law, and hiring, thus, highlighting the need for
transparency. However, the key challenge is to balance transparency --
clarifying `why' a decision was made -- with recourse: providing actionable
steps on `how' to achieve a favourable outcome from an unfavourable outcome.
Counterfactual explanations reveal `why' an undesired outcome occurred and
`how' to reverse it through targeted feature changes (interventions).
  Current counterfactual approaches have limitations: 1) they often ignore
causal dependencies between features, and 2) they typically assume all
interventions can happen simultaneously, an unrealistic assumption in practical
scenarios where actions are typically taken in a sequence. As a result, these
counterfactuals are often not achievable in the real world.
  We present P2C (Path-to-Counterfactuals), a model-agnostic framework that
produces a plan (ordered sequence of actions) converting an unfavourable
outcome to a causally consistent favourable outcome. P2C addresses both
limitations by 1) Explicitly modelling causal relationships between features
and 2) Ensuring that each intermediate state in the plan is feasible and
causally valid. P2C uses the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system
s(CASP) to generate the plan accounting for feature changes that happen
automatically due to causal dependencies. Furthermore, P2C refines cost
(effort) computation by only counting changes actively made by the user,
resulting in realistic cost estimates. Finally, P2C highlights how its causal
planner outperforms standard planners, which lack causal knowledge and thus can
generate illegal actions.

Motivation: 现有指令数据生成方法注重多样性但忽略了实际应用中的任务相关性，大多数现实应用需要针对特定用例的任务特定知识

Method: 提出Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA)框架，在离散查询-约束空间中系统扩展指令，保持多样性和任务对齐

Result: TCIA将开源LLM在四个真实世界任务特定应用上的性能平均提升8.7%，在某些情况下甚至超过领先的闭源模型

Conclusion: TCIA是一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，能够在不损害通用指令跟随能力的情况下，使LLM适应现实世界的任务导向应用

Abstract: Diverse instruction data is vital for effective instruction tuning of large
language models, as it enables the model to generalize across different types
of inputs . Building such diversified instruction dataset is an essential step
in this process. Existing approaches often leverage large language models to
automatically explore and generate diverse instructions, ensuring both data
diversity and quality. However, they tend to overlook an important factor in
real-world applications: on-task relevance. In practice, only a few real-world
applications require a truly general-purpose model; most benefit from
task-specific knowledge tailored to their particular use case. Therefore, it is
vital to develop instruction augmentation methods that not only maintain
diversity but are also optimized for specific, real-world scenarios.
  We thus introduce Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA), a framework
that systematically expands instructions while preserving both diversity and
task alignment. By representing instructions in a discrete query-constraints
space, TCIA creates a rich set of task-relevant instructions and enables models
to generalize to these task-specific instructions without sacrificing overall
performance. Experiments show that TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance
by an average of 8.7% across four real-world, task-specific applications, and
in some cases outperforming leading closed-source models. These improvements do
not compromise general instruction-following ability, making TCIA a scalable
and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to real-world, task-focused
applications.

Result: EAS与答案熵在不同模型和数据集上呈现强相关性，在训练数据选择中优于通过率过滤方法，提高了数学基准上的学生模型准确率

Conclusion: EAS是一种高效且可解释的不确定性建模工具，为LLM训练中的数据质量评估提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Entropy Area Score (EAS), a simple yet effective
metric to quantify uncertainty in the answer generation process of reasoning
large language models (LLMs). EAS requires neither external models nor repeated
sampling, it integrates token-level predictive entropy from the model itself to
capture the evolution of uncertainty during generation. Empirical results show
that EAS is strongly correlated with answer entropy across models and datasets.
In training data selection, EAS identifies high-potential samples and
consistently outperforms Pass Rate filtering under equal sample budgets,
improving student model accuracy on math benchmarks. EAS is both efficient and
interpretable, offering a practical tool for uncertainty modeling and data
quality assessment in LLM training.

bottleneck especially pronounced in complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address
this, we introduce AWorld, an open-source system engineered for large-scale
agent-environment interaction. By distributing tasks across a cluster, AWorld
accelerates experience collection by 14.6x compared to standard single-node,
sequential execution. This critical speedup makes extensive reinforcement

Conclusion: GAI框架为AI安全治理提供了可行且可推广的技术路径，通过密码学机制确保即使在面对未来AI时也能提供计算上不可破解的安全保障

Abstract: As AI rapidly advances, the security risks posed by AI are becoming
increasingly severe, especially in critical scenarios, including those posing
existential risks. If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively
evades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI
safety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human
intervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI
with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee
security. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework
that shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced
structural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are
computationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined
threat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework
is composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible,
and general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a
governable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection
against compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules
and the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable
technical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line
defined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability,
tamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack
vectors. This paper also presents a rigorous formal proof of the security
properties of this mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness through a
prototype implementation evaluated in representative high-stakes scenarios.

Conclusion: LLM驱动的合成数据增强能有效提升健康相关事实核查器的性能

Abstract: Fact-checking for health-related content is challenging due to the limited
availability of annotated training data. In this study, we propose a synthetic
data generation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment
training data for health-related fact checking. In this pipeline, we summarize
source documents, decompose the summaries into atomic facts, and use an LLM to
construct sentence-fact entailment tables. From the entailment relations in the
table, we further generate synthetic text-claim pairs with binary veracity
labels. These synthetic data are then combined with the original data to
fine-tune a BERT-based fact-checking model. Evaluation on two public datasets,
PubHealth and SciFact, shows that our pipeline improved F1 scores by up to
0.019 and 0.049, respectively, compared to models trained only on the original
data. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-driven synthetic data

Abstract: In Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs), auto-leveling
bots exploit automated programs to level up characters at scale, undermining
gameplay balance and fairness. Detecting such bots is challenging, not only
because they mimic human behavior, but also because punitive actions require
explainable justification to avoid legal and user experience issues. In this
paper, we present a novel framework for detecting auto-leveling bots by
leveraging contrastive representation learning and clustering techniques in a
fully unsupervised manner to identify groups of characters with similar
level-up patterns. To ensure reliable decisions, we incorporate a Large
Language Model (LLM) as an auxiliary reviewer to validate the clustered groups,
effectively mimicking a secondary human judgment. We also introduce a growth
curve-based visualization to assist both the LLM and human moderators in
assessing leveling behavior. This collaborative approach improves the
efficiency of bot detection workflows while maintaining explainability, thereby
supporting scalable and accountable bot regulation in MMORPGs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文综述了人工智能与认知科学的交叉关系，指出AI发展主要关注实用任务性能，而认知基础仍概念分散，建议未来应构建能加深对人类心智理解的系统


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人工智能与认知科学之间的互惠关系，认知科学深刻影响了AI等多个学科，而AI也成为推进认知研究的重要工具

Method: 通过综合两个视角的关键贡献进行综述分析，观察AI进展与认知基础的关系

Result: 发现AI进步主要强调实际任务性能，但其认知基础在概念上仍然分散

Conclusion: AI在认知科学中的未来不仅在于提高性能，更在于构建能够加深对人类心智理解的系统，包括使AI行为与认知框架对齐、在具身和文化中定位AI、开发个性化认知模型，以及通过认知共同评估重新思考AI伦理

Abstract: Cognitive Science has profoundly shaped disciplines such as Artificial
Intelligence (AI), Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, Linguistics, and
Culture. Many breakthroughs in AI trace their roots to cognitive theories,
while AI itself has become an indispensable tool for advancing cognitive
research. This reciprocal relationship motivates a comprehensive review of the
intersections between AI and Cognitive Science. By synthesizing key
contributions from both perspectives, we observe that AI progress has largely
emphasized practical task performance, whereas its cognitive foundations remain
conceptually fragmented. We argue that the future of AI within Cognitive
Science lies not only in improving performance but also in constructing systems
that deepen our understanding of the human mind. Promising directions include
aligning AI behaviors with cognitive frameworks, situating AI in embodiment and
culture, developing personalized cognitive models, and rethinking AI ethics
through cognitive co-evaluation.

Conclusion: 该范畴论框架成功提升了AI系统的可解释性，为词嵌入提供了透明的数学基础，能够在语义空间层面识别和缓解偏差，推动了可解释人工智能领域的发展。

Abstract: The paper introduces a novel framework based on category theory to enhance
the explainability of artificial intelligence systems, particularly focusing on
word embeddings. Key topics include the construction of categories
$\mathcal{L}_T$ and $\mathcal{P}_T$, providing schematic representations of the
semantics of a text $ T $, and reframing the selection of the element with
maximum probability as a categorical notion. Additionally, the monoidal
category $\mathcal{P}_T$ is constructed to visualize various methods of
extracting semantic information from $T$, offering a dimension-agnostic
definition of semantic spaces reliant solely on information within the text.
  Furthermore, the paper defines the categories of configurations Conf and word
embeddings $\mathcal{Emb}$, accompanied by the concept of divergence as a
decoration on $\mathcal{Emb}$. It establishes a mathematically precise method
for comparing word embeddings, demonstrating the equivalence between the GloVe
and Word2Vec algorithms and the metric MDS algorithm, transitioning from neural
network algorithms (black box) to a transparent framework. Finally, the paper
presents a mathematical approach to computing biases before embedding and
offers insights on mitigating biases at the semantic space level, advancing the
field of explainable artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) serve as an active and promising field of
generative artificial intelligence and have demonstrated abilities to perform
complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific
reasoning. In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving
representative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent,
incorporating a "rewriting-resolution-review-revision" logical chain via three
reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer,
respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The
Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link
problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem
descriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible
for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem
resolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for
self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code
runtime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable
code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive
evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in
solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis
problems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly
improves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of
non-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for
autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review
mechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN
solutions) rate of the latest reasoning models. In summary, our agent framework
establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising scientific
computing paradigm.

TL;DR: 提出基于单智能体强化学习的公交驻站控制框架，通过分类标识符增强状态空间，将多智能体问题转化为单智能体问题，在非环线现实场景中实现更稳定的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体强化学习在环线设置中忽略了现实运营的异质性路线、时刻表、波动需求和可变车队规模等问题，存在数据不平衡和收敛困难

Method: 构建双向时刻表网络和动态乘客需求，通过车辆ID、站点ID、时间段等分类标识符增强状态空间，设计基于运营目标的岭形奖励函数，使用改进的软演员-评论家算法

Result: 改进的SAC算法在随机条件下表现更稳定优异（-430k vs -530k），相比MADDPG等基准方法有显著提升

Conclusion: 单智能体深度强化学习通过分类结构化和时刻表感知奖励增强，能够有效管理非环线现实场景中的公交驻站控制，为MARL框架提供了稳健可扩展的替代方案

Abstract: Bus bunching remains a challenge for urban transit due to stochastic traffic
and passenger demand. Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations
characterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and
varying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning
(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and
convergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional
timetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key
innovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by
augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station
ID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,
velocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to
capture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs
into a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function
aligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway
deviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule
adherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves
more stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,
-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that
single-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and
schedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,
real-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to
MARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个动态系统化的医学指南基准测试，将WHO IMCI手册转化为包含200+节点和300+边的有向图，通过图遍历生成400+问题，覆盖3.3万亿种组合，用于评估LLM在医疗任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统手动构建基准测试覆盖范围有限的问题，创建能够动态生成、全面覆盖医疗指南关系的系统化评估方法，以识别通用评估可能遗漏的特定能力差距。

Method: 将WHO IMCI手册转化为有向图结构，使用图遍历算法生成包含年龄特定场景和上下文干扰项的医学问题，创建动态多项选择题基准测试。

Result: 模型在症状识别方面表现良好（45-67%准确率），但在严重程度分级、治疗方案和随访护理方面存在困难，证明了定制化基准测试能发现通用评估忽略的能力缺陷。

Conclusion: 图基方法成功解决了手动策划基准测试的覆盖限制，为创建可动态生成、防污染的综合基准测试提供了可扩展解决方案，特别是在指南更新时能保持时效性。

Abstract: We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of
medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible
combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO
IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms,
treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal
to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual
distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables
systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find
models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity,
treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks
can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss.
Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training
(supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward
samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach
successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks.
This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution
for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated,
including when the guidelines are updated. Code and datasets are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗行业人员排班面临患者负荷波动、临床技能多样性和控制人工成本等多重挑战，需要平衡相互冲突的目标

Method: 使用多目标遗传算法(MOO-GA)，建立包含小时预约驱动需求和模块化班次的多技能人员排班模型，定义成本、护理覆盖和员工满意度三个目标函数

Result: 在典型医院单元数据集上测试，算法生成的排班方案平均比传统手动排班性能提升66%，能够有效管理关键运营和员工目标之间的权衡

Conclusion: 该方法为护士长和医院管理者提供了实用的决策支持工具，能够生成稳健平衡的排班方案

Abstract: Workforce scheduling in the healthcare sector is a significant operational
challenge, characterized by fluctuating patient loads, diverse clinical skills,
and the critical need to control labor costs while upholding high standards of
patient care. This problem is inherently multi-objective, demanding a delicate
balance between competing goals: minimizing payroll, ensuring adequate staffing
for patient needs, and accommodating staff preferences to mitigate burnout. We
propose a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) that models the hospital
unit workforce scheduling problem as a multi-objective optimization task. Our
model incorporates real-world complexities, including hourly appointment-driven
demand and the use of modular shifts for a multi-skilled workforce. By defining
objective functions for cost, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction,
the GA navigates the vast search space to identify a set of high-quality,
non-dominated solutions. Demonstrated on datasets representing a typical
hospital unit, the results show that our MOO-GA generates robust and balanced
schedules. On average, the schedules produced by our algorithm showed a 66\%
performance improvement over a baseline that simulates a conventional, manual
scheduling process. This approach effectively manages trade-offs between
critical operational and staff-centric objectives, providing a practical
decision support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可微分神经符号架构和专用损失函数，用于从自然输入中学习解决NP难推理问题，在多个基准测试中表现出高效性和优越性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在将离散推理与神经网络融合的过程中，需要能够从自然输入学习解决离散推理或优化问题的神经架构，这是大语言模型难以胜任的任务

Method: 采用新的概率损失函数，可以同时学习约束和目标，将组合求解器移出训练循环，实现可扩展训练，同时通过精确推理获得最大精度

Result: 在数独基准测试的三个变体（符号、视觉和多解版本）上，该方法所需训练时间仅为其他混合方法的一小部分；在视觉最小割/最大割任务中，优化效果优于专用后悔损失；能够高效学习蛋白质设计这一大型实际问题的能量优化公式

Conclusion: 该神经符号架构能够高效地从自然输入中学习解决NP难推理问题，在多个任务上展现出优越的性能和训练效率

Abstract: In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets,
there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to
solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task
that Large Language Models seem to struggle with.
  Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a
loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems.
  Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints
and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and
completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the
training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact
inference gives access to maximum accuracy.
  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve
NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku
benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a
fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut
task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning
regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization
formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.

Motivation: 全球有3600万人受物质使用障碍影响，但由于污名化、动机障碍和个性化支持有限，很少人获得有效治疗。现有语言模型缺乏临床验证策略的紧密整合

Method: 构建多智能体对话框架，结合动态患者建模、情境敏感治疗对话和自适应说服策略。使用两阶段训练流程：监督微调(SFT)后接直接偏好优化(DPO)，并在涵盖易、中、高抵抗级别的合成基准上训练

Result: ChatThero使患者动机平均提升41.5%，治疗信心增加0.49%，在困难案例中比GPT-4o少用26%的对话轮次。自动和人工临床评估均显示其在同理心、响应性和行为真实性方面评分更高

Conclusion: 该框架支持严格、保护隐私的治疗对话研究，为研究和临床转化提供了稳健、可复现的基础

Abstract: Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect over 36 million people worldwide, yet
few receive effective care due to stigma, motivational barriers, and limited
personalized support. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for
mental-health assistance, most systems lack tight integration with clinically
validated strategies, reducing effectiveness in addiction recovery. We present
ChatThero, a multi-agent conversational framework that couples dynamic patient
modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive
strategies grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational
interviewing (MI). We build a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark spanning Easy,
Medium, and Hard resistance levels, and train ChatThero with a two-stage
pipeline comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference
optimization (DPO). In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5\% average gain in
patient motivation, a 0.49\% increase in treatment confidence, and resolves
hard cases with 26\% fewer turns than GPT-4o, and both automated and human
clinical assessments rate it higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral
realism. The framework supports rigorous, privacy-preserving study of
therapeutic conversation and provides a robust, replicable basis for research
and clinical translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感推荐系统调查缺乏基于心理学的组织分类法，且往往只研究特定类型的情感状态或应用领域，需要更全面的系统性综述。

Method: 基于Scherer的情感状态类型学，引入四类分类方案：态度感知、情绪感知、心境感知和混合系统，并记录情感信号提取技术、系统架构和应用领域。

Result: 建立了全面的情感推荐系统分类框架，识别了关键趋势和局限性，强调了跨模态混合模型的重要性。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注利用多种情感状态的混合模型、开发大规模情感感知数据集，以及用认知和社会心理学的精确术语替代民间情感词汇。

Abstract: Affective Recommender Systems are an emerging class of intelligent systems
that aim to enhance personalization by aligning recommendations with users'
affective states. Reflecting a growing interest, a number of surveys have been
published in this area, however they lack an organizing taxonomy grounded in
psychology and they often study only specific types of affective states or
application domains. This survey addresses these limitations by providing a
comprehensive, systematic review of affective recommender systems across
diverse domains. Drawing from Scherer's typology of affective states, we
introduce a classification scheme that organizes systems into four main
categories: attitude aware, emotion aware, mood aware, and hybrid. We further
document affective signal extraction techniques, system architectures, and
application areas, highlighting key trends, limitations, and open challenges.
As future research directions, we emphasize hybrid models that leverage
multiple types of affective states across different modalities, the development
of large-scale affect-aware datasets, and the need to replace the folk
vocabulary of affective states with a more precise terminology grounded in
cognitive and social psychology. Through its systematic review of existing
research and challenges, this survey aims to serve as a comprehensive reference
and a useful guide for advancing academic research and industry applications in
affect-driven personalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统在细粒度用户-物品交互和可解释性方面存在不足，用户越来越需要透明的推荐解释，而现有方法要么无法充分利用预训练Transformer能力，要么忽视了对个性化解释至关重要的方面建模

Method: 提出ELIXIR多任务模型，基于T5-small架构，联合学习用户和物品的全局及方面特定表示，优化整体评分、方面级评分和评论生成，使用个性化注意力机制强调方面重要性

Result: 在TripAdvisor和RateBeer数据集上的实验表明，ELIXIR显著优于强基线模型，特别是在评论生成方面表现突出，即使使用较小的模型也能超越使用更大模型的现有方法

Conclusion: ELIXIR通过方面建模和多任务学习有效提升了推荐系统的可解释性，证明了基于方面的架构在个性化文本生成中的有效性，为构建高效透明的推荐系统提供了新思路

Abstract: Collaborative filtering drives many successful recommender systems but
struggles with fine-grained user-item interactions and explainability. As users
increasingly seek transparent recommendations, generating textual explanations
through language models has become a critical research area. Existing methods
employ either RNNs or Transformers. However, RNN-based approaches fail to
leverage the capabilities of pre-trained Transformer models, whereas
Transformer-based methods often suffer from suboptimal adaptation and neglect
aspect modeling, which is crucial for personalized explanations. We propose
ELIXIR (Efficient and LIghtweight model for eXplaIning Recommendations), a
multi-task model combining rating prediction with personalized review
generation. ELIXIR jointly learns global and aspect-specific representations of
users and items, optimizing overall rating, aspect-level ratings, and review
generation, with personalized attention to emphasize aspect importance. Based
on a T5-small (60M) model, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our aspect-based
architecture in guiding text generation in a personalized context, where
state-of-the-art approaches exploit much larger models but fail to match user
preferences as well. Experimental results on TripAdvisor and RateBeer
demonstrate that ELIXIR significantly outperforms strong baseline models,
especially in review generation.

Abstract: In music recommendation systems, multimodal interest learning is pivotal,
which allows the model to capture nuanced preferences, including textual
elements such as lyrics and various musical attributes such as different
instruments and melodies. Recently, methods that incorporate multimodal content
features through semantic IDs have achieved promising results. However,
existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: 1) intra-modal semantic
degradation, where residual-based quantization processes gradually decouple
discrete IDs from original content semantics, leading to semantic drift; and 2)
inter-modal modeling gaps, where traditional fusion strategies either overlook
modal-specific details or fail to capture cross-modal correlations, hindering
comprehensive user interest modeling. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel multimodal recommendation framework with two stages. In the first stage,
our Progressive Semantic Residual Quantization (PSRQ) method generates
modal-specific and modal-joint semantic IDs by explicitly preserving the prefix
semantic feature. In the second stage, to model multimodal interest of users, a
Multi-Codebook Cross-Attention (MCCA) network is designed to enable the model
to simultaneously capture modal-specific interests and perceive cross-modal
correlations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate
that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. This framework has
been deployed on one of China's largest music streaming platforms, and online
A/B tests confirm significant improvements in commercial metrics, underscoring
its practical value for industrial-scale recommendation systems.

Motivation: 现代信息检索系统存在对受保护类别（如性别、种族）的偏见问题，需要开发能够减少偏见同时保持结果相关性的查询推荐方法。

Method: 扩展BalancedQR框架，采用帕累托前沿方法优化多个目标（性别偏见、地域偏见和结果相关性），在多维度上寻找平衡的查询建议。

Result: 在Wikipedia数据集上的评估表明，扩展后的BalancedQR框架有效减少了多维度偏见，同时突显了查询措辞和语言选择对检索结果的显著影响。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了在多维度偏见减少和结果相关性之间的平衡，证明了查询表述细微变化对信息检索公平性的重要性。

Abstract: Modern IR systems are an extremely important tool for seeking information. In
addition to search, such systems include a number of query reformulation
methods, such as query expansion and query recommendations, to provide high
quality results. However, results returned by such methods sometimes exhibit
undesirable or wrongful bias with respect to protected categories such as
gender or race. Our earlier work considered the problem of balanced query
recommendation, where instead of re-ranking a list of results based on fairness
measures, the goal was to suggest queries that are relevant to a user's search
query but exhibit less bias than the original query. In this work, we present a
case study of BalancedQR using an extension of BalancedQR that handles biases
in multiple dimensions. It employs a Pareto front approach that finds balanced
queries, optimizing for multiple objectives such as gender bias and regional
bias, along with the relevance of returned results. We evaluate the extended
version of BalancedQR on a Wikipedia dataset.Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our extension to BalancedQR framework and highlight the
significant impact of subtle query wording,linguistic choice on retrieval.

Method: 提出MPFormer动态多任务Transformer框架，包含三个创新机制：1）目标条件化Transformer通过可学习注意力调制联合编码用户行为序列和多任务语义；2）引入个性化目标权重实现检索结果的动态调整；3）将用户个性化信息融入token表示和Transformer结构以增强模型表示能力。

Result: 该框架已成功集成到快手短视频推荐系统，稳定服务超过4亿日活跃用户，显著提升了用户日常参与度和系统运营效率。实际部署验证显示，相比传统解决方案，在保持服务响应速度的同时有效优化了多目标检索的迭代范式。

Conclusion: MPFormer为工业推荐系统提供了一个可扩展的多目标解决方案，成功解决了多阶段优化不对齐问题，在保持服务性能的同时实现了多目标检索的优化。

Abstract: Modern industrial recommendation systems encounter a core challenge of
multi-stage optimization misalignment: a significant semantic gap exists
between the multi-objective optimization paradigm widely used in the ranking
phase and the single-objective modeling in the retrieve phase. Although the
mainstream industry solution achieves multi-objective coverage through parallel
multi-path single-objective retrieval, this approach leads to linear growth of
training and serving resources with the number of objectives and has inherent
limitations in handling loosely coupled objectives. This paper proposes the
MPFormer, a dynamic multi-task Transformer framework, which systematically
addresses the aforementioned issues through three innovative mechanisms. First,
an objective-conditioned transformer that jointly encodes user behavior
sequences and multi-task semantics through learnable attention modulation;
second, personalized target weights are introduced to achieve dynamic
adjustment of retrieval results; finally, user personalization information is
incorporated into token representations and the Transformer structure to
further enhance the model's representation ability. This framework has been
successfully integrated into Kuaishou short video recommendation system, stably
serving over 400 million daily active users. It significantly improves user
daily engagement and system operational efficiency. Practical deployment
verification shows that, compared with traditional solutions, it effectively
optimizes the iterative paradigm of multi-objective retrieval while maintaining
service response speed, providing a scalable multi-objective solution for
industrial recommendation systems.

*Alexandre Andre,Gauthier Roy,Eva Dyer,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个专门评估零上下文推荐公平性的基准测试，发现在冷启动场景下LLMs存在性别和文化刻板印象等偏见，并揭示了模型大小与公平性之间的非线性关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推荐任务中应用日益广泛，但在冷启动场景下（只有年龄、性别等有限信号可用时），它们可能依赖预训练中编码的社会偏见，引发公平性担忧。

Method: 引入模块化流水线，支持可配置的推荐领域和敏感属性，能够系统灵活地审计任何开源LLM，在音乐、电影和大学等推荐领域评估最先进模型。

Result: 评估发现Gemma 3和Llama 3.2等先进模型在多个推荐领域存在一致的偏见，包括性别和文化刻板印象，同时揭示了模型大小与公平性之间的非线性关系。

Conclusion: 需要更细致的分析来理解LLMs在冷启动推荐中的公平性问题，模型大小增加并不总是带来公平性改善，有时反而会加剧偏见。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for recommendation tasks
due to their general-purpose capabilities. While LLMs perform well in
rich-context settings, their behavior in cold-start scenarios, where only
limited signals such as age, gender, or language are available, raises fairness
concerns because they may rely on societal biases encoded during pretraining.
We introduce a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate fairness in
zero-context recommendation. Our modular pipeline supports configurable
recommendation domains and sensitive attributes, enabling systematic and
flexible audits of any open-source LLM. Through evaluations of state-of-the-art
models (Gemma 3 and Llama 3.2), we uncover consistent biases across
recommendation domains (music, movies, and colleges) including gendered and
cultural stereotypes. We also reveal a non-linear relationship between model
size and fairness, highlighting the need for nuanced analysis.

*Haoyu Wu,Qingcheng Zeng,Kaize Ding*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 检索器和重排序器在RAG系统中存在事实性能力显著下降的问题，相比其基础大语言模型，准确率普遍下降12-43个百分点，主要依赖表面语义相似性而非事实推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究密集检索器和重排序器在检索增强生成(RAG)管道中的事实性能力继承情况，评估这些组件在保持系统可信度和防御RAG中毒方面的表现。

Method: 将12个公开嵌入检查点与其原始基础LLM配对，在事实性基准上评估两者表现；使用GPT-4.1改写正确答案创建改写测试集，分析语义相似性对决策的影响。

Result: 所有嵌入模型变体的准确率都显著低于基础模型，中位数下降28个百分点；在候选池从4个扩展到1000个选项时，最强检索器的top-1准确率从33%降至26%；改写测试集后准确率降至原始水平的三分之一。

Conclusion: 对比学习为检索器引入了系统性权衡：语义检索能力的提升是以参数化事实知识的损失为代价的，检索器主要依赖表面语义相似性而非深层次的事实推理能力。

Abstract: Dense retrievers and rerankers are central to retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) pipelines, where accurately retrieving factual information is crucial for
maintaining system trustworthiness and defending against RAG poisoning.
However, little is known about how much factual competence these components
inherit or lose from the large language models (LLMs) they are based on. We
pair 12 publicly released embedding checkpoints with their original base LLMs
and evaluate both sets on a factuality benchmark. Across every model evaluated,
the embedding variants achieve markedly lower accuracy than their bases, with
absolute drops ranging from 12 to 43 percentage points (median 28 pts) and
typical retriever accuracies collapsing into the 25-35 % band versus the 60-70
% attained by the generative models. This degradation intensifies under a more
demanding condition: when the candidate pool per question is expanded from four
options to one thousand, the strongest retriever's top-1 accuracy falls from 33
% to 26 %, revealing acute sensitivity to distractor volume. Statistical tests
further show that, for every embedding model, cosine-similarity scores between
queries and correct completions are significantly higher than those for
incorrect ones (p < 0.01), indicating decisions driven largely by surface-level
semantic proximity rather than factual reasoning. To probe this weakness, we
employed GPT-4.1 to paraphrase each correct completion, creating a rewritten
test set that preserved factual truth while masking lexical cues, and observed
that over two-thirds of previously correct predictions flipped to wrong,
reducing overall accuracy to roughly one-third of its original level. Taken
together, these findings reveal a systematic trade-off introduced by
contrastive learning for retrievers: gains in semantic retrieval are paid for
with losses in parametric factual knowledge......

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多行为序列推荐中，传统方法认为高频信息是噪声而低频信息有价值，但作者认为高频信息同样重要，对应着用户兴趣的多样性，需要重新审视频域信息的价值。

Method: 提出PDB4Rec模型，有效提取不同频带信息及其关系，并引入Boostrapping Balancer机制来平衡不同频带信息对推荐性能的贡献。

Result: 在真实数据集上的充分实验证明了模型的有效性和效率，验证了高频信息对用户兴趣多样性的重要性。

Conclusion: 高频信息并非无意义，它代表了用户兴趣的多样性，通过适当平衡不同频带信息的贡献可以显著提升多行为序列推荐的性能。

Abstract: In recommendation systems, users often exhibit multiple behaviors, such as
browsing, clicking, and purchasing. Multi-behavior sequential recommendation
(MBSR) aims to consider these different behaviors in an integrated manner to
improve the recommendation performance of the target behavior. However, some
behavior data will also bring inevitable noise to the modeling of user
interests. Some research efforts focus on data denoising from the frequency
domain perspective to improve the accuracy of user preference prediction. These
studies indicate that low-frequency information tends to be valuable and
reliable, while high-frequency information is often associated with noise. In
this paper, we argue that high-frequency information is by no means
insignificant. Further experimental results highlight that low frequency
corresponds to the purity of user interests, while high frequency corresponds
to the diversity of user interests. Building upon this finding, we proposed our
model PDB4Rec, which efficiently extracts information across various frequency
bands and their relationships, and introduces Boostrapping Balancer mechanism
to balance their contributions for improved recommendation performance.
Sufficient experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our model.

TL;DR: 本文分析了旅游推荐系统中的多利益相关者公平性问题，指出计算机科学领域对现实世界复杂利益关系的理解不足，建议通过跨学科合作来改进算法决策支持系统


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 算法推荐系统经常无意中引导旅游流量，对环境和当地社区产生负面影响，这源于计算机科学界对现实世界复杂利益关系和权衡的有限理解

Method: 通过半系统性文献综述，综合旅游管理和计算机科学领域的文献，分析两者在研究方法和视角上的差异

Result: 研究发现旅游管理采用定性、包容和参与式方法来研究公平性，而计算机科学主要依赖少数数学化的公平标准，未能捕捉旅游公平的多维性质

Conclusion: 需要跨学科合作来增强算法决策支持系统，以理解和支持真正的多利益相关者公平性

Abstract: Algorithmic decision-support systems, i.e., recommender systems, are popular
digital tools that help tourists decide which places and attractions to
explore. However, algorithms often unintentionally direct tourist streams in a
way that negatively affects the environment, local communities, or other
stakeholders. This issue can be partly attributed to the computer science
community's limited understanding of the complex relationships and trade-offs
among stakeholders in the real world.
  In this work, we draw on the practical findings and methods from tourism
management to inform research on multistakeholder fairness in algorithmic
decision-support. Leveraging a semi-systematic literature review, we synthesize
literature from tourism management as well as literature from computer science.
Our findings suggest that tourism management actively tries to identify the
specific needs of stakeholders and utilizes qualitative, inclusive and
participatory methods to study fairness from a normative and holistic research
perspective. In contrast, computer science lacks sufficient understanding of
the stakeholder needs and primarily considers fairness through descriptive
factors, such as measureable discrimination, while heavily relying on few
mathematically formalized fairness criteria that fail to capture the
multidimensional nature of fairness in tourism.
  With the results of this work, we aim to illustrate the shortcomings of
purely algorithmic research and stress the potential and particular need for
future interdisciplinary collaboration. We believe such a collaboration is a
fundamental and necessary step to enhance algorithmic decision-support systems
towards understanding and supporting true multistakeholder fairness in tourism.

Method: 开发了'基于语义的概念检索使用组斯坦纳树'算法，整合领域信息来增强语义感知的知识表示和数据访问，并在真实数据上实现文档检索系统

Result: 在170个真实搜索查询的基准测试中，系统达到90%的精确度和82%的准确率，相比基线系统有显著提升

Conclusion: 提出的SemDR系统通过整合领域特定知识，显著提高了文档检索的精确性和准确性，展示了在语义感知检索方面的有前景的改进

Abstract: Retrieving pertinent documents from various data sources with diverse
characteristics poses a significant challenge for Document Retrieval Systems.
The complexity of this challenge is further compounded when accounting for the
semantic relationship between data and domain knowledge. While existing
retrieval systems using semantics (usually represented as Knowledge Graphs
created from open-access resources and generic domain knowledge) hold promise
in delivering relevant outcomes, their precision may be compromised due to the
absence of domain-specific information and reliance on outdated knowledge
sources. In this research, the primary focus is on two key contributions- a)
the development of a versatile algorithm- 'Semantic-based Concept Retrieval
using Group Steiner Tree' that incorporates domain information to enhance
semantic-aware knowledge representation and data access, and b) the practical
implementation of the proposed algorithm within a document retrieval system
using real-world data. To assess the effectiveness of the SemDR system,
research work conducts performance evaluations using a benchmark consisting of
170 real-world search queries. Rigorous evaluation and verification by domain
experts are conducted to ensure the validity and accuracy of the results. The
experimental findings demonstrate substantial advancements when compared to the
baseline systems, with precision and accuracy achieving levels of 90% and 82%
respectively, signifying promising improvements.

Abstract: Understanding multimodal video ads is crucial for improving query-ad matching
and relevance ranking on short video platforms, enhancing advertising
effectiveness and user experience. However, the effective utilization of
multimodal information with high commercial value still largely constrained by
reliance on highly compressed video embeddings-has long been inadequate. To
address this, we propose SUMMA (the abbreviation of Summarizing MultiModal
Ads), a multimodal model that automatically processes video ads into summaries
highlighting the content of highest commercial value, thus improving their
comprehension and ranking in Douyin search-advertising systems. SUMMA is
developed via a two-stage training strategy-multimodal supervised fine-tuning
followed by reinforcement learning with a mixed reward mechanism-on
domain-specific data containing video frames and ASR/OCR transcripts,
generating commercially valuable and explainable summaries. We integrate
SUMMA-generated summaries into our production pipeline, directly enhancing the
candidate retrieval and relevance ranking stages in real search-advertising
systems. Both offline and online experiments show substantial improvements over
baselines, with online results indicating a statistically significant 1.5%
increase in advertising revenue. Our work establishes a novel paradigm for
condensing multimodal information into representative texts, effectively
aligning visual ad content with user query intent in retrieval and
recommendation scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于会话的推荐模型虽然使用物品序列进行预测，但往往忽略了物品标题或描述中的语义信息，影响了会话意图识别和可解释性。现有的LLM方法存在提示工程困难或计算成本高的问题。

Method: 提出了三种方法：(1)上下文LLM作为推荐代理；(2)LLM生成表示用于深度学习SR模型的语义初始化；(3)LLM与数据驱动SR模型的集成。在两个真实世界数据集上进行综合实验。

Result: LLM方法在粗粒度检索(高召回值)方面表现优异，而传统数据驱动技术在细粒度排序(高MRR值)方面表现良好。集成方法在召回率和MRR指标上均显著优于单独的LLM方法和数据驱动深度学习模型。

Conclusion: LLM与数据驱动SR模型的集成方法能够结合两者的优势，在基于会话的推荐任务中取得了最佳性能，为解决会话意图识别和推荐可解释性问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Session-based recommendation (SR) models aim to recommend items to anonymous
users based on their behavior during the current session. While various SR
models in the literature utilize item sequences to predict the next item, they
often fail to leverage semantic information from item titles or descriptions
impeding session intent identification and interpretability. Recent research
has explored Large Language Models (LLMs) as promising approaches to enhance
session-based recommendations, with both prompt-based and fine-tuning based
methods being widely investigated. However, prompt-based methods struggle to
identify optimal prompts that elicit correct reasoning and lack task-specific
feedback at test time, resulting in sub-optimal recommendations. Fine-tuning
methods incorporate domain-specific knowledge but incur significant
computational costs for implementation and maintenance. In this paper, we
present multiple approaches to utilize LLMs for session-based recommendation:
(i) in-context LLMs as recommendation agents, (ii) LLM-generated
representations for semantic initialization of deep learning SR models, and
(iii) integration of LLMs with data-driven SR models. Through comprehensive
experiments on two real-world publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that
LLM-based methods excel at coarse-level retrieval (high recall values), while
traditional data-driven techniques perform well at fine-grained ranking (high
Mean Reciprocal Rank values). Furthermore, the integration of LLMs with
data-driven SR models significantly out performs both standalone LLM approaches
and data-driven deep learning models, as well as baseline SR models, in terms
of both Recall and MRR metrics.

Abstract: In long structured document retrieval, existing methods typically fine-tune
pre-trained language models (PLMs) using contrastive learning on datasets
lacking explicit structural information. This practice suffers from two
critical issues: 1) current methods fail to leverage structural features and
element-level semantics effectively, and 2) the lack of datasets containing
structural metadata. To bridge these gaps, we propose \our, a novel contrastive
learning framework. It leverages structure-aware learning to preserve semantic
hierarchies and masked element alignment for fine-grained semantic
discrimination. Furthermore, we release \dataset, a long structured document
retrieval dataset with rich structural annotations. Extensive experiments on
both released and industrial datasets across various modern PLMs, along with
online A/B testing, demonstrate consistent performance improvements, boosting
NDCG@10 from 73.96\% to 77.84\% on BGE-M3. The resources are available at

Conclusion: 用户感知的无偏学习排序框架能够有效解决个性化偏见问题，通过考虑用户差异提高了排序模型的性能。

Abstract: Unbiased learning to rank (ULTR), which aims to learn unbiased ranking models
from biased user behavior logs, plays an important role in Web search. Previous
research on ULTR has studied a variety of biases in users' clicks, such as
position bias, presentation bias, and outlier bias. However, existing work
often assumes that the behavior logs are collected from an ``average'' user,
neglecting the differences between different users in their search and browsing
behaviors. In this paper, we introduce personalized factors into the ULTR
framework, which we term the user-aware ULTR problem. Through a formal causal
analysis of this problem, we demonstrate that existing user-oblivious methods
are biased when different users have different preferences over queries and
personalized propensities of examining documents. To address such a
personalized bias, we propose a novel user-aware inverse-propensity-score
estimator for learning-to-rank objectives. Specifically, our approach models
the distribution of user browsing behaviors for each query and aggregates
user-weighted examination probabilities to determine propensities. We
theoretically prove that the user-aware estimator is unbiased under some mild
assumptions and shows lower variance compared to the straightforward way of
calculating a user-dependent propensity for each impression. Finally, we
empirically verify the effectiveness of our user-aware estimator by conducting
extensive experiments on two semi-synthetic datasets and a real-world dataset.

Conclusion: DMQN通过端到端处理长行为序列，有效解决了传统两阶段方法的注意力分布差异问题，在保持高效率的同时显著提升了CTR预测性能。

Abstract: In Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, the long behavior sequence,
comprising the user's long period of historical interactions with items has a
vital influence on assessing the user's interest in the candidate item.
Existing approaches strike efficiency and effectiveness through a two-stage
paradigm: first retrieving hundreds of candidate-related items and then
extracting interest intensity vector through target attention. However, we
argue that the discrepancy in target attention's relevance distribution between
the retrieved items and the full long behavior sequence inevitably leads to a
performance decline. To alleviate the discrepancy, we propose the Deep Multiple
Quantization Network (DMQN) to process long behavior sequence end-to-end
through compressing the long behavior sequence. Firstly, the entire spectrum of
long behavior sequence will be quantized into multiple codeword sequences based
on multiple independent codebooks. Hierarchical Sequential Transduction Unit is
incorporated to facilitate the interaction of reduced codeword sequences. Then,
attention between the candidate and multiple codeword sequences will output the
interest vector. To enable online serving, intermediate representations of the
codeword sequences are cached, significantly reducing latency. Our extensive
experiments on both industrial and public datasets confirm the effectiveness
and efficiency of DMQN. The A/B test in our advertising system shows that DMQN
improves CTR by 3.5% and RPM by 2.0%.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have transformed recommender systems
through end-to-end generation. OneRec reformulates recommendation as an
autoregressive generation task, achieving high Model FLOPs Utilization. While
OneRec-V1 has shown significant empirical success in real-world deployment, two

encoding rather than generation, and (2) limitations in reinforcement learning
relying solely on reward models.
  To address these challenges, we propose OneRec-V2, featuring: (1) Lazy

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive recommendation models (ARMs), such as Meta's HSTU
model, have emerged as a major breakthrough over traditional Deep Learning
Recommendation Models (DLRMs), exhibiting the highly sought-after scaling law
behaviour. However, when applied to multi-domain scenarios, the transformer
architecture's attention maps become a computational bottleneck, as they attend
to all items across every domain. To tackle this challenge, systems must
efficiently balance inter and intra-domain knowledge transfer. In this work, we
introduce a novel approach for scalable multi-domain recommendation systems by
replacing full inter-domain attention with two innovative mechanisms: 1)
Transition-Aware Positional Embeddings (TAPE): We propose novel positional
embeddings that account for domain-transition specific information. This allows
attention to be focused solely on intra-domain items, effectively reducing the
unnecessary computational cost associated with attending to irrelevant domains.
2) Dynamic Domain State Representation (DDSR): We introduce a dynamic state
representation for each domain, which is stored and accessed during subsequent
token predictions. This enables the efficient transfer of relevant domain
information without relying on full attention maps. Our method offers a
scalable solution to the challenges posed by large-scale, multi-domain
recommendation systems and demonstrates significant improvements in retrieval
tasks by separately modelling and combining inter- and intra-domain
representations.

### [187] [On the Theoretical Limitations of Embedding-Based Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21038)
*Orion Weller,Michael Boratko,Iftekhar Naim,Jinhyuk Lee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文通过理论分析和实证研究表明，即使在简单查询的现实场景中，向量嵌入模型也存在根本性理论局限，无法处理所有可能的top-k检索子集，挑战了现有单向量范式的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着向量嵌入在检索、推理、代码生成等任务中的广泛应用，现有研究普遍认为嵌入模型的局限性主要源于不现实的查询，可以通过更好的训练数据和更大模型来克服。本文旨在验证这些理论局限是否会在现实简单查询中出现。

Method: 结合学习理论中的已知结果，证明嵌入维度限制了能够作为查询结果返回的top-k文档子集数量。通过实证研究验证这一理论，即使限制k=2并在测试集上自由参数化优化，仍存在局限。创建了一个名为LIMIT的现实数据集来压力测试模型。

Result: 实证研究表明，即使是最先进的嵌入模型在LIMIT数据集上也表现失败，尽管任务性质简单。这证实了理论局限在现实场景中的存在。

Conclusion: 现有单向量范式的嵌入模型存在根本性理论局限，无法处理所有可能的检索需求。研究呼吁未来开发能够解决这一根本局限的新方法。

Abstract: Vector embeddings have been tasked with an ever-increasing set of retrieval
tasks over the years, with a nascent rise in using them for reasoning,
instruction-following, coding, and more. These new benchmarks push embeddings
to work for any query and any notion of relevance that could be given. While
prior works have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings,
there is a common assumption that these difficulties are exclusively due to
unrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome with better
training data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may
encounter these theoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely
simple queries. We connect known results in learning theory, showing that the
number of top-k subsets of documents capable of being returned as the result of
some query is limited by the dimension of the embedding. We empirically show
that this holds true even if we restrict to k=2, and directly optimize on the
test set with free parameterized embeddings. We then create a realistic dataset
called LIMIT that stress tests models based on these theoretical results, and
observe that even state-of-the-art models fail on this dataset despite the
simple nature of the task. Our work shows the limits of embedding models under
the existing single vector paradigm and calls for future research to develop
methods that can resolve this fundamental limitation.

TL;DR: CrystalICL是一个用于few-shot晶体生成的新模型，通过基于空间群的晶体标记化方法和条件-结构感知混合指令调优框架，有效利用上下文学习能力来生成具有所需物化性质的晶体材料。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的晶体生成方法仅限于零样本场景，无法受益于少样本学习，而人类专家通常通过修改相关已知结构来设计新材料，这与少样本上下文学习范式高度契合。

Method: 提出基于空间群的晶体标记化方法降低晶体对称性建模复杂度；设计条件-结构感知混合指令调优框架和多任务指令调优策略，从有限数据中捕捉结构-性质关系。

Conclusion: CrystalICL成功地将少样本上下文学习范式应用于晶体材料设计，为具有所需物化性质的晶体生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Designing crystal materials with desired physicochemical properties remains a
fundamental challenge in materials science. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated strong in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, existing
LLM-based crystal generation approaches are limited to zero-shot scenarios and
are unable to benefit from few-shot scenarios. In contrast, human experts
typically design new materials by modifying relevant known structures which
aligns closely with the few-shot ICL paradigm. Motivated by this, we propose
CrystalICL, a novel model designed for few-shot crystal generation.
Specifically, we introduce a space-group based crystal tokenization method,
which effectively reduces the complexity of modeling crystal symmetry in LLMs.
We further introduce a condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning
framework and a multi-task instruction tuning strategy, enabling the model to
better exploit ICL by capturing structure-property relationships from limited
data. Extensive experiments on four crystal generation benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of CrystalICL over the leading baseline methods on conditional
and unconditional generation tasks.

Conclusion: 在Transformer模型前端添加轻量级可学习滤波器是提升长时序预测性能的有效方法，既能改善频谱利用率，又能减少模型复杂度。

Abstract: Transformer-based models are at the forefront in long time-series forecasting
(LTSF). While in many cases, these models are able to achieve state of the art
results, they suffer from a bias toward low-frequencies in the data and high
computational and memory requirements. Recent work has established that
learnable frequency filters can be an integral part of a deep forecasting model
by enhancing the model's spectral utilization. These works choose to use a
multilayer perceptron to process their filtered signals and thus do not solve
the issues found with transformer-based models. In this paper, we establish
that adding a filter to the beginning of transformer-based models enhances
their performance in long time-series forecasting. We add learnable filters,
which only add an additional $\approx 1000$ parameters to several
transformer-based models and observe in multiple instances 5-10 \% relative
improvement in forecasting performance. Additionally, we find that with filters
added, we are able to decrease the embedding dimension of our models, resulting
in transformer-based architectures that are both smaller and more effective
than their non-filtering base models. We also conduct synthetic experiments to
analyze how the filters enable Transformer-based models to better utilize the
full spectrum for forecasting.

Motivation: 将Wiener线性预测器扩展到非线性预测器，建立transformer与经典非线性滤波理论之间的联系，为现代推理架构提供理论解释。

Method: 提出概率模型将transformer信号解释为条件度量的代理，将层操作建模为定点更新过程，特别针对隐马尔可夫模型推导出显式的定点更新形式。

Result: 建立了transformer与非线性滤波理论的联系，为transformer的层操作提供了概率解释，并在HMM特殊情况下给出了具体的数学表达。

Conclusion: 这项工作成功地将经典非线性滤波理论与现代transformer架构连接起来，为理解transformer的内部机制提供了新的理论视角，特别是在条件概率度量方面的解释。

Abstract: In the 1940s, Wiener introduced a linear predictor, where the future
prediction is computed by linearly combining the past data. A transformer
generalizes this idea: it is a nonlinear predictor where the next-token
prediction is computed by nonlinearly combining the past tokens. In this essay,
we present a probabilistic model that interprets transformer signals as
surrogates of conditional measures, and layer operations as fixed-point
updates. An explicit form of the fixed-point update is described for the
special case when the probabilistic model is a hidden Markov model (HMM). In
part, this paper is in an attempt to bridge the classical nonlinear filtering
theory with modern inference architectures.

Motivation: 虽然知识蒸馏在深度学习模型压缩中表现有效，但尚未完全理解哪些因素真正影响学生模型性能提升。本文旨在探索教师模型校准对学生性能的影响

Method: 通过使用校准方法来降低教师模型的校准误差，然后将校准后的教师模型用于知识蒸馏过程。该方法具有通用性，可轻松集成到现有最先进方法中

Result: 实验表明该方法在各种任务（从分类到检测）中都有效，能够持续实现优越性能

Conclusion: 教师模型的校准是知识蒸馏中一个重要因素，通过简单降低教师校准误差即可显著提升知识蒸馏效果

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression
technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large
teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant
success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving
the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation
between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore,
we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for
effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be
improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's
calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness
across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be
easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently
achieving superior performance.

TL;DR: 提出CLD（损失差异相关性）核心集选择方法，通过计算训练样本损失与验证集损失轨迹的对齐度来识别最具影响力的样本，无需昂贵梯度计算，实现高效可扩展的数据集优化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在实时或资源受限场景下面临可扩展性挑战，现有子集选择方法需要昂贵的梯度和曲率计算，需要开发更简单高效的样本选择方法

Method: CLD方法仅需训练检查点的逐样本损失值，通过测量训练样本损失与验证集损失轨迹的相关性来选择核心集，避免梯度计算，理论框架证明收敛误差上界由所选样本对齐度和验证集代表性决定

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1k上，CLD核心集在不同子集大小下通常优于或接近最先进方法，即使不领先时也保持在计算昂贵基线方法的1%以内；能有效跨架构迁移（ResNet、VGG、DenseNet），代理到目标选择性能下降<1%；仅使用早期检查点时稳定，精度损失可忽略；通过每类验证对齐实现固有偏差减少

Conclusion: CLD是一种原理清晰、高效、稳定且可迁移的工具，适用于可扩展的数据集优化，为解决深度学习模型的可扩展性挑战提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but
face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To
address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and
scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful
training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a
held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample
loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient
and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We
develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees
for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is
upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the
representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k,
CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art
methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally
expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across
architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with
<1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints,
incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias
reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional
stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled,
efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.

Abstract: We present an analysis of the transductive node classification problem, where
the underlying graph consists of communities that agree with the node labels
and node features. For node classification, we propose a novel optimization
problem that incorporates the node-specific information (labels and features)
in a spectral graph clustering framework. Studying this problem, we demonstrate
a synergy between the graph structure and node-specific information. In
particular, we show that suitable node-specific information guarantees the
solution of our optimization problem perfectly recovering the communities,
under milder conditions than the bounds on graph clustering alone. We present
algorithmic solutions to our optimization problem and numerical experiments
that confirm such a synergy.

Abstract: Autonomous experiments (AEs) are transforming how scientific research is
conducted by integrating artificial intelligence with automated experimental
platforms. Current AEs primarily focus on the optimization of a predefined
target; while accelerating this goal, such an approach limits the discovery of
unexpected or unknown physical phenomena. Here, we introduce a novel framework,
INS2ANE (Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration),
to enhance the discovery of novel phenomena in autonomous experimentation. Our
method integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that
evaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling
mechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they
appear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a
pre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral
pairs. We further implement the process on autonomous scanning probe microscopy
experiments. INS2ANE significantly increases the diversity of explored
phenomena in comparison to conventional optimization routines, enhancing the
likelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena. These results
demonstrate the potential for AE to enhance the depth of scientific discovery;
in combination with the efficiency provided by AEs, this approach promises to
accelerate scientific research by simultaneously navigating complex
experimental spaces to uncover new phenomena.

Abstract: The process of discovering equations from data lies at the heart of physics
and in many other areas of research, including mathematical ecology and
epidemiology. Recently, machine learning methods known as symbolic regression
have automated this process. As several methods are available in the
literature, it is important to compare them, particularly for dynamic systems
that describe complex phenomena. In this paper, five symbolic regression
methods were used for recovering equations from nine dynamical processes,
including chaotic dynamics and epidemic models, with the PySR method proving to
be the most suitable for inferring equations. Benchmark results demonstrate its
high predictive power and accuracy, with some estimates being indistinguishable
from the original analytical forms. These results highlight the potential of
symbolic regression as a robust tool for inferring and modelling real-world
phenomena.

Conclusion: 该方法为存在隐藏因素情况下的因果效应估计提供了一个有效的框架

Abstract: Latent variable models provide a powerful framework for incorporating and
inferring unobserved factors in observational data. In causal inference, they
help account for hidden factors influencing treatment or outcome, thereby
addressing challenges posed by missing or unmeasured covariates. This paper
proposes a new framework that integrates latent variable modeling into the
double machine learning (DML) paradigm to enable robust causal effect
estimation in the presence of such hidden factors. We consider two scenarios:
one where a latent variable affects only the outcome, and another where it may
influence both treatment and outcome. To ensure tractability, we incorporate
latent variables only in the second stage of DML, separating representation
learning from latent inference. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness
of our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Abstract: Although traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methods have
contributed significantly to genetics and, in particular, inherited disease
diagnosis, they often struggle with complex, high-dimensional data, a challenge
now addressed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. Large language models
(LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring
contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review
examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare
and common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv,
medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in
diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated
models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in
genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as
medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate
that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk
stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report
generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic
sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust
pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation
in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and
assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming
hereditary disease diagnostics and supporting genetic education, serving as a

Abstract: This paper introduce a novel metric of an objective function f, we say VC
(value change) to measure the difficulty and approximation affection when
conducting an neural network approximation task, and it numerically supports
characterizing the local performance and behavior of neural network
approximation. Neural networks often suffer from unpredictable local
performance, which can hinder their reliability in critical applications. VC
addresses this issue by providing a quantifiable measure of local value changes
in network behavior, offering insights into the stability and performance for
achieving the neural-network approximation. We investigate some fundamental
theoretical properties of VC and identified two intriguing phenomena in neural
network approximation: the VC-tendency and the minority-tendency. These trends
respectively characterize how pointwise errors evolve in relation to the
distribution of VC during the approximation process.In addition, we propose a
novel metric based on VC, which measures the distance between two functions
from the perspective of variation. Building upon this metric, we further
propose a new preprocessing framework for neural network approximation.
Numerical results including the real-world experiment and the PDE-related
scientific problem support our discovery and pre-processing acceleration

Conclusion: Beacon提供了一种简单、有效且无需手动调优的逐通道后训练量化方法，通过几何特性自动确定缩放因子，在保持竞争力的同时简化了量化过程。

Abstract: Quantization is a widely used compression technique for reducing the memory
and computation costs of large pre-trained models. A key challenge in
per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) is selecting appropriate scaling
factors to replace weight values with values from a scaled quantization grid.
Existing methods typically fix the scale at the outset via heuristic tuning or
grid search. In this note, we propose Beacon, a simple and effective algorithm
that eliminates the need for such manual tuning. Beacon performs per-channel
PTQ directly using a fixed non-scaled alphabet and automatically determines the
optimal scaling factors by exploiting the geometry of symmetric scalar
quantization. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization with
minimal modifications and does not rely on back-propagation or large
calibration sets. Despite its simplicity and tuning-free nature, Beacon
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, making
it a practical solution for efficient model deployment.

Conclusion: DALI通过潜在空间实现反事实一致性，理论证明编码器对于高效上下文推断和鲁棒泛化至关重要，为处理潜在上下文提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning demands adaptation to unseen environmental
conditions without costly retraining. Contextual Markov Decision Processes
(cMDP) model this challenge, but existing methods often require explicit
context variables (e.g., friction, gravity), limiting their use when contexts
are latent or hard to measure. We introduce Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination
(DALI), a framework integrated within the Dreamer architecture that infers
latent context representations from agent-environment interactions. By training
a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, DALI generates
actionable representations conditioning the world model and policy, bridging
perception and control. We theoretically prove this encoder is essential for
efficient context inference and robust generalization. DALI's latent space
enables counterfactual consistency: Perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension
alters imagined rollouts in physically plausible ways. On challenging cMDP
benchmarks, DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines,
often surpassing context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling
zero-shot generalization to unseen contextual variations.

TL;DR: FedReFT是一种联邦学习中的参数高效微调方法，通过直接操纵隐藏表示而非更新模型权重，在保持高参数效率的同时解决了异构数据下的聚合不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统参数高效微调方法在联邦学习中面临客户端数据分布、模型能力和计算资源的异构性挑战，特别是表示级更新容易受到聚合不匹配的影响。

Method: 提出FedReFT方法，应用稀疏干预层直接引导隐藏表示，并设计All-But-Me聚合机制，让每个客户端接收其他客户端的聚合更新并部分整合，平衡本地专注和全局知识。

Result: 在常识推理、算术推理、指令调优和GLUE基准测试中，FedReFT consistently优于最先进的PEFT方法，参数效率比基于LoRA的方法高7-15倍。

Conclusion: FedReFT为边缘设备提供了轻量级且语义丰富的微调替代方案，通过表示级干预和创新的聚合机制有效解决了联邦学习中的异构性挑战。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has attracted significant attention
for adapting large pre-trained models by modifying a small subset of
parameters. Recently, Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) has emerged as an
effective alternative. ReFT shifts the fine-tuning paradigm from updating model
weights to directly manipulating hidden representations that capture rich
semantic information, and performs better than state-of-the-art PEFTs in
standalone settings. However, its application in Federated Learning (FL)
remains challenging due to heterogeneity in clients' data distributions, model
capacities, and computational resources. To address these challenges, we
introduce Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT), a novel approach to
fine-tune the client's hidden representation. FedReFT applies sparse
intervention layers to steer hidden representations directly, offering a
lightweight and semantically rich fine-tuning alternative ideal for edge
devices. However, representation-level updates are especially vulnerable to
aggregation mismatch under different task heterogeneity, where naive averaging
can corrupt semantic alignment. To mitigate this issue, we propose All-But-Me
(ABM) aggregation, where each client receives the aggregated updates of others
and partially incorporates them, enabling stable and personalized learning by
balancing local focus with global knowledge. We evaluate FedReFT on commonsense
reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE, where it
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL, achieving 7x-15x
higher parameter efficiency compared to leading LoRA-based approaches.

Abstract: The growing complexity of urban mobility and the demand for efficient,
sustainable, and adaptive solutions have positioned Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) at the forefront of modern infrastructure innovation. At the core
of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large
scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals,
autonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these
challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies
that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper
presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a
structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination
models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor
critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across
key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous
vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems.
Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA,
and CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks.
The survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non
stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real
transfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于双图卷积网络的门控融合框架，从邮件数据中建模员工的任务语义相似性（WHAT）和协作结构特征（HOW），显著提升内部人才推荐的性能并具有高可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统内部人才推荐方法存在结构性局限，仅依赖少数管理者的狭隘视角，容易忽视合格候选人。需要从更全面的维度评估员工与新职位的匹配度。

Method: 使用双图卷积网络（GCN）分别建模员工的任务语义相似性图（WHAT）和协作交互结构图（HOW），通过门控机制自适应融合这两个维度。

Result: 在Hit@100指标上达到40.9%的顶级性能，显著优于其他融合策略和启发式基线。模型对不同职位家族学习到不同的融合策略，具有高可解释性。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个量化且全面的内部人才发现框架，通过实证确定任务对齐和协作模式之间的最优融合比例，为员工在新职位上的成功提供重要实践意义。

Abstract: Internal talent recommendation is a critical strategy for organizational
continuity, yet conventional approaches suffer from structural limitations,
often overlooking qualified candidates by relying on the narrow perspective of
a few managers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that
models two distinct dimensions of an employee's position fit from email data:
WHAT they do (semantic similarity of tasks) and HOW they work (structural
characteristics of their interactions and collaborations). These dimensions are
represented as independent graphs and adaptively fused using a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) with a gating mechanism. Experiments show that our
proposed gating-based fusion model significantly outperforms other fusion
strategies and a heuristic baseline, achieving a top performance of 40.9% on
Hit@100. Importantly, it is worth noting that the model demonstrates high
interpretability by learning distinct, context-aware fusion strategies for
different job families. For example, it learned to prioritize relational (HOW)
data for 'sales and marketing' job families while applying a balanced approach
for 'research' job families. This research offers a quantitative and
comprehensive framework for internal talent discovery, minimizing the risk of
candidate omission inherent in traditional methods. Its primary contribution
lies in its ability to empirically determine the optimal fusion ratio between
task alignment (WHAT) and collaborative patterns (HOW), which is required for
employees to succeed in the new positions, thereby offering important practical
implications.

TL;DR: Forge是一种预训练方法，通过向量量化图自编码器在大规模混合整数规划(MIP)实例上进行无监督学习，无需依赖问题求解，为优化问题提供通用嵌入表示


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法需要为每个问题分布训练专用模型，计算开销大且泛化能力有限，需要一种通用的预训练方法来提高可扩展性和泛化性

Method: 使用向量量化图自编码器在大规模多样化MIP实例集上进行无监督预训练，通过离散代码分配创建表示优化实例的词汇表

Result: 在无监督设置下，Forge嵌入能有效区分和聚类未见实例；在有监督设置下，单个模型可预测多个问题类型的预热变量和整数间隙，提升商业求解器性能

Conclusion: Forge提供了一种有效的MIP实例级嵌入方法，在无监督和有监督任务中都表现出色，为优化问题的通用表示学习开辟了新途径

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and
engineering, yet learning-based approaches to accelerate their solution often
require solving a large number of hard-to-solve optimization instances to
collect training data, incurring significant computational overhead. Existing
methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution for
each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization.
In this work, we introduce Forge, a method of pre-training a vector-quantized
graph autoencoder on a large and diverse collection of mixed-integer
programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised fashion without dependency on
their solution. The vector quantization process creates discrete code
assignments that act as a vocabulary to represent optimization instances. We
evaluate our approach under both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the
unsupervised setting, we demonstrate that Forge embeddings effectively
differentiate and cluster unseen instances. For the supervised setting, we
fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single model predicts both the
variables for warm-starts and integrality gaps for cut-generation across
multiple problem type distributions. Both predictions help improve performance
of a state-of-the-art, commercial optimization solver. Finally, we release our
code and pre-trained Forge weights to encourage further research and practical
use of instance-level MIP embeddings at https://github.com/skadio/forge/

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI)的投毒攻击方法，通过利用LLMs的对齐机制，在特定话题上触发拒绝回答，从而植入偏见或实施针对性审查，且能逃避现有防御检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通过训练拒绝回答有害提示来满足伦理标准和安全要求，但攻击者可能利用这种对齐机制来植入偏见或实施审查。

Method: 提出SAI投毒攻击，通过在训练数据中植入特定触发条件，使模型在预定义话题上拒绝回答，同时保持对其他话题的正常响应。

Result: 实验显示，仅1%的数据投毒就能导致ChatDoctor系统对特定种族群体的医疗问题拒绝回答，产生23%的偏见；在简历筛选任务中产生27%的偏见；在其他9个聊天应用中偏见达到38%。

Conclusion: SAI攻击能够有效规避现有防御机制，揭示了LLMs对齐机制可能被滥用于植入偏见和审查的实际风险，需要开发新的防御方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to meet ethical standards and safety
requirements by training them to refuse answering harmful or unsafe prompts. In
this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to
implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's
responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive
Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment
mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the
adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced
through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to
inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning
defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation
techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate
the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on
LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as
ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare
questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of
23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume
selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected
university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher
bias ($\Delta DP$~38%) results on 9 other chat based downstream applications.

TL;DR: 本文比较了合成控制法(SCM)和面板双重机器学习(DML)在衡量地理层级营销效果时的表现，发现DML方法在复杂场景下比SCM更稳健可靠


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确量化双边市场地理层级营销效果具有挑战性，SCM方法虽然功效高但会系统性地低估效应大小，而面板DML方法很少与SCM进行基准比较

Method: 构建了一个开放、完全文档化的模拟器，模拟典型的大规模地理推广实验，在五种压力测试场景下评估了7种估计器（3种ASC变体和4种面板DML变体）

Result: ASC模型在涉及非线性或外部冲击的挑战性场景中表现出严重偏差和接近零的覆盖率，而面板DML变体显著减少了这种偏差并恢复了名义95%置信区间覆盖率

Conclusion: 建议采用'先诊断后选择'框架，首先识别主要业务挑战，然后选择最适合该场景的特定DML模型，为地理实验分析提供更稳健可靠的蓝图

Abstract: Accurately quantifying geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces is
challenging: the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) often exhibits high power yet
systematically under-estimates effect size, while panel-style Double Machine
Learning (DML) is seldom benchmarked against SCM. We build an open, fully
documented simulator that mimics a typical large-scale geo roll-out: N_unit
regional markets are tracked for T_pre weeks before launch and for a further
T_post-week campaign window, allowing all key parameters to be varied by the
user and probe both families under five stylized stress tests: 1) curved
baseline trends, 2) heterogeneous response lags, 3) treated-biased shocks, 4) a
non-linear outcome link, and 5) a drifting control group trend.
  Seven estimators are evaluated: three standard Augmented SCM (ASC) variants
and four panel-DML flavors (TWFE, CRE/Mundlak, first-difference, and
within-group). Across 100 replications per scenario, ASC models consistently
demonstrate severe bias and near-zero coverage in challenging scenarios
involving nonlinearities or external shocks. By contrast, panel-DML variants
dramatically reduce this bias and restore nominal 95%-CI coverage, proving far
more robust.
  The results indicate that while ASC provides a simple baseline, it is
unreliable in common, complex situations. We therefore propose a
'diagnose-first' framework where practitioners first identify the primary
business challenge (e.g., nonlinear trends, response lags) and then select the
specific DML model best suited for that scenario, providing a more robust and
reliable blueprint for analyzing geo-experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CTXSEG的自适应分段方法，用于EEG信号处理，相比固定长度分段能提高癫痫检测性能并减少所需分段数量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统EEG机器学习使用固定时间片段进行信号分割，但脑状态并不局限于固定间隔，这种方法可能缺乏生物学相关性。需要研究自适应分段方法是否对EEG机器学习分析有益

Method: 开发了CTXSEG自适应分段方法，基于EEG数据的统计差异创建变长分段，并使用可控合成数据CTXGEN进行评估。在癫痫检测问题上验证该方法，并与固定长度分段进行比较

Result: 使用CTXSEG准备EEG数据在标准化框架下评估时，相比固定长度方法提高了癫痫检测性能，且不需要修改机器学习方法，同时需要更少的分段

Conclusion: CTXSEG自适应分段可以轻松应用于现代机器学习方法，有潜力提高性能。它是信号预处理中固定长度分段的有前景的替代方案，应该被视为EEG机器学习应用中标准预处理工具的一部分

Abstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling
continuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals
for machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The
current naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited
biological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals.
We investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine
learning EEG analysis.
  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that
creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG
data and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that
typically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable
synthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG
method has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying
it to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG
with fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG
machine learning pipeline for seizure detection.
  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure
detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using
a standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and
requires fewer segments.
  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG
can be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to
improve performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation
for signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard
preprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications.

Method: 通过求解Riccati类矩阵微分方程获得闭式解，分析不同分量动力学的时间尺度分离现象

Result: 证明了增量学习行为源于学习目标矩阵不同分量时的时间尺度分离，减小初始化尺度会增强这种分离，从而能够找到目标矩阵的低秩近似

Conclusion: 为理解梯度流在矩阵分解中的隐式偏差提供了定量分析框架，并讨论了将分析扩展到非对称矩阵分解问题的可能途径

Abstract: Many theoretical studies on neural networks attribute their excellent
empirical performance to the implicit bias or regularization induced by
first-order optimization algorithms when training networks under certain
initialization assumptions. One example is the incremental learning phenomenon
in gradient flow (GF) on an overparamerterized matrix factorization problem
with small initialization: GF learns a target matrix by sequentially learning
its singular values in decreasing order of magnitude over time. In this paper,
we develop a quantitative understanding of this incremental learning behavior
for GF on the symmetric matrix factorization problem, using its closed-form
solution obtained by solving a Riccati-like matrix differential equation. We
show that incremental learning emerges from some time-scale separation among
dynamics corresponding to learning different components in the target matrix.
By decreasing the initialization scale, these time-scale separations become
more prominent, allowing one to find low-rank approximations of the target
matrix. Lastly, we discuss the possible avenues for extending this analysis to
asymmetric matrix factorization problems.

Motivation: 现有联邦检索方法在处理模糊查询时效果不佳，特别是在跨域场景中难以检索到高质量相关文档，限制了在下游生成任务中的有效性

Method: 利用LLMs中的动态信息流，通过少量标注查询的梯度信号和基于Shapley值的归因分析来追踪神经元激活路径，识别意图和子域边界；通过多原型对比学习训练对齐模块，实现细粒度源内建模和跨知识库的语义对齐

Result: 在五个基准测试中，DFAMS在知识分类准确率上比先进方法提升14.37%，检索召回率提升5.38%，下游QA准确率提升6.45%

Conclusion: DFAMS框架在复杂联邦检索场景中表现出色，通过动态信息流分析有效解决了跨域模糊查询的检索难题

Abstract: Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge
sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge
is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and
relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios,
which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream
generation tasks. Inspired by dynamic information flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS,
a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and
construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval
across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by
leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley
value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent
recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to
train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling
fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across
knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS
outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification
accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy,
demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

Abstract: Is there a way for a designer to evaluate the performance of a given hood
frame geometry without spending significant time on simulation setup? This
paper seeks to address this challenge by developing a multimodal
machine-learning (MMML) architecture that learns from different modalities of
the same data to predict performance metrics. It also aims to use the MMML
architecture to enhance the efficiency of engineering design processes by
reducing reliance on computationally expensive simulations. The proposed
architecture accelerates design exploration, enabling rapid iteration while
maintaining high-performance standards, especially in the concept design phase.
The study also presents results that show that by combining multiple data
modalities, MMML outperforms traditional single-modality approaches. Two new
frame geometries, not part of the training dataset, are also used for
prediction using the trained MMML model to showcase the ability to generalize
to unseen frame models. The findings underscore MMML's potential in
supplementing traditional simulation-based workflows, particularly in the
conceptual design phase, and highlight its role in bridging the gap between
machine learning and real-world engineering applications. This research paves
the way for the broader adoption of machine learning techniques in engineering
design, with a focus on refining multimodal approaches to optimize structural
development and accelerate the design cycle.

Abstract: Airbnb is a leader in offering travel accommodations. Airbnb has historically
relied on structured data to understand, rank, and recommend listings to guests
due to the limited capabilities and associated complexity arising from
extracting meaningful information from text and images. With the rise of
representation learning, leveraging rich information from text and photos has
become easier. A popular approach has been to create embeddings for text
documents and images to enable use cases of computing similarities between
listings or using embeddings as features in an ML model.
  However, an Airbnb listing has diverse unstructured data: multiple images,
various unstructured text documents such as title, description, and reviews,
making this approach challenging. Specifically, it is a non-trivial task to
combine multiple embeddings of different pieces of information to reach a
single representation.
  This paper proposes BiListing, for Bimodal Listing, an approach to align text
and photos of a listing by leveraging large-language models and pretrained
language-image models. The BiListing approach has several favorable
characteristics: capturing unstructured data into a single embedding vector per
listing and modality, enabling zero-shot capability to search inventory
efficiently in user-friendly semantics, overcoming the cold start problem, and
enabling listing-to-listing search along a single modality, or both.
  We conducted offline and online tests to leverage the BiListing embeddings in
the Airbnb search ranking model, and successfully deployed it in production,
achieved 0.425% of NDCB gain, and drove tens of millions in incremental
revenue.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals serve as a foundational data source for
cardiac digital twins, yet their diagnostic utility is frequently compromised
by noise and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose TF-TransUNet1D, a
novel one-dimensional deep neural network that integrates a U-Net-based
encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer encoder, guided by a hybrid
time-frequency domain loss. The model is designed to simultaneously capture
local morphological features and long-range temporal dependencies, which are
critical for preserving the diagnostic integrity of ECG signals. To enhance
denoising robustness, we introduce a dual-domain loss function that jointly
optimizes waveform reconstruction in the time domain and spectral fidelity in
the frequency domain. In particular, the frequency-domain component effectively
suppresses high-frequency noise while maintaining the spectral structure of the
signal, enabling recovery of subtle but clinically significant waveform
components. We evaluate TF-TransUNet1D using synthetically corrupted signals
from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the Noise Stress Test Database
(NSTDB). Comparative experiments against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate
consistent superiority of our model in terms of SNR improvement and error
metrics, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.1285 and Pearson correlation
coefficient of 0.9540. By delivering high-precision denoising, this work
bridges a critical gap in pre-processing pipelines for cardiac digital twins,
enabling more reliable real-time monitoring and personalized modeling.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern artificial
intelligence, but its core self-attention mechanism suffers from a complexity
bottleneck that scales quadratically with sequence length, severely limiting
its application in long-sequence tasks. To address this challenge, existing
linear attention methods typically sacrifice model performance by relying on
data-agnostic kernel approximations or restrictive context selection. This
paper returns to the first principles of connectionism, starting from the
topological structure of information flow, to introduce a novel linear
attention architecture-\textbf{TLinFormer}. By reconfiguring neuron connection
patterns, TLinFormer achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact
attention scores and ensuring information flow remains aware of the full
historical context. This design aims to bridge the performance gap prevalent
between existing efficient attention methods and standard attention. Through a
series of experiments, we systematically evaluate the performance of TLinFormer
against a standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence inference tasks. The
results demonstrate that TLinFormer exhibits overwhelming advantages in key
metrics such as \textbf{inference latency}, \textbf{KV cache efficiency},
\textbf{memory footprint}, and \textbf{overall speedup}.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的几何正则化方法——非线性保角正则化，用于深度神经网络解码器映射，能够量化潜在空间到原始数据空间的局部变形程度，并计算学习流形的标量曲率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降维旨在发现解释数据的主要因素，自编码器是学习低维表示的有效方法。但传统方法缺乏对解码器映射几何特性的量化分析，需要新的正则化技术来理解潜在空间的局部变形特性。

Method: 引入非线性保角正则化技术，通过约束解码器映射的局部保角性质，产生一个称为保角因子的标量场，用于量化潜在空间映射到原始数据空间时的局部变形程度。

Result: 该方法能够有效量化解码器映射的局部几何特性，计算学习流形的标量曲率，在Swiss roll和CelebA数据集上的实验验证了该技术的可行性。

Conclusion: 非线性保角正则化为自编码器提供了一种新的几何约束方法，不仅能够学习低维表示，还能量化分析潜在空间的几何变形特性，为理解深度学习模型的几何结构提供了新工具。

Abstract: One aim of dimensionality reduction is to discover the main factors that
explain the data, and as such is paramount to many applications. When working
with high dimensional data, autoencoders offer a simple yet effective approach
to learn low-dimensional representations. The two components of a general
autoencoder consist first of an encoder that maps the observed data onto a
latent space; and second a decoder that maps the latent space back to the
original observation space, which allows to learn a low-dimensional manifold
representation of the original data. In this article, we introduce a new type
of geometric regularization for decoding maps approximated by deep neural
networks, namely nonlinear conformal regularization. This regularization
procedure permits local variations of the decoder map and comes with a new
scalar field called conformal factor which acts as a quantitative indicator of
the amount of local deformation sustained by the latent space when mapped into
the original data space. We also show that this regularization technique allows
the computation of the scalar curvature of the learned manifold. Implementation
and experiments on the Swiss roll and CelebA datasets are performed to
illustrate how to obtain these quantities from the architecture.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究结合传统可解释AI和评分驱动解释方法，评估不同时间序列预测模型在多个领域的性能与可解释性，发现特征工程模型在波动性强的领域表现优于基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列预测模型在实际应用中越来越重要，但模型复杂、性能不稳定且不透明，用户难以理解模型为何成功或失败，这在实际应用中可能带来严重后果。

Method: 结合传统可解释AI(XAI)方法和评分驱动解释(RDE)，评估四种模型架构(ARIMA、梯度提升、Chronos、Llama)在金融、能源、交通和汽车销售四个不同领域数据集上的表现。

Result: 特征工程模型(如梯度提升)在波动性或稀疏性领域(如电力、汽车零部件)表现优于基础模型(如Chronos)且提供更可解释的结果，而基础模型仅在稳定或趋势驱动的场景(如金融)中表现优异。

Conclusion: 模型选择应考虑领域特性，波动性强的领域更适合特征工程模型，而稳定领域可考虑基础模型，同时需要关注模型的可解释性以确保实际应用的可靠性。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting models (TSFM) have evolved from classical statistical
methods to sophisticated foundation models, yet understanding why and when
these models succeed or fail remains challenging. Despite this known
limitation, time series forecasting models are increasingly used to generate
information that informs real-world actions with equally real consequences.
Understanding the complexity, performance variability, and opaque nature of
these models then becomes a valuable endeavor to combat serious concerns about
how users should interact with and rely on these models' outputs. This work
addresses these concerns by combining traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods
with Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) to assess TSFM performance and
interpretability across diverse domains and use cases. We evaluate four
distinct model architectures: ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos (time-series
specific foundation model), Llama (general-purpose; both fine-tuned and base
models) on four heterogeneous datasets spanning finance, energy,
transportation, and automotive sales domains. In doing so, we demonstrate that
feature-engineered models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) consistently outperform
foundation models (e.g., Chronos) in volatile or sparse domains (e.g., power,
car parts) while providing more interpretable explanations, whereas foundation
models excel only in stable or trend-driven contexts (e.g., finance).

TL;DR: 本文研究了状态空间模型(SSM)的对角线初始化方案，从频率角度分析其学习偏差，提出了基于离散傅里叶域的对角初始化方法S4D-DFouT，在长序列建模任务上取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SSM参数初始化主要依赖HiPPO框架，但其对角变体的作用未被明确研究。对角线SSM虽然效率更高，但其初始化机制和学习偏差需要系统性的理解。

Method: 从频率角度系统研究对角线SSM初始化方案，分析参数化方式和学习偏差，提出基于离散傅里叶域的对角初始化方法S4D-DFouT，并研究极点放置的作用。

Result: 提出的S4D-DFouT方法在Long Range Arena基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，能够在PathX-256等大型数据集上从头开始训练。

Conclusion: 通过频率视角分析对角线SSM初始化，揭示了极点放置的重要性，提出的S4D-DFouT方法显著提升了长序列建模性能，为大规模SSM训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current methods for initializing state space models (SSMs) parameters mainly
rely on the \textit{HiPPO framework}, which is based on an online approximation
of orthogonal polynomials. Recently, diagonal alternatives have shown to reach
a similar level of performance while being significantly more efficient due to
the simplification in the kernel computation. However, the \textit{HiPPO
framework} does not explicitly study the role of its diagonal variants. In this
paper, we take a further step to investigate the role of diagonal SSM
initialization schemes from the frequency perspective. Our work seeks to
systematically understand how to parameterize these models and uncover the
learning biases inherent in such diagonal state-space models. Based on our
observations, we propose a diagonal initialization on the discrete Fourier
domain \textit{S4D-DFouT}. The insights in the role of pole placing in the
initialization enable us to further scale them and achieve state-of-the-art
results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, allowing us to train from scratch on
very large datasets as PathX-256.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EAGLE-PC是一个新的机器遗忘框架，通过嵌入空间相似性测量和ICL生成的代理约束，解决了现有遗忘方法中遗忘边界不明确的问题，在保持模型效用的同时实现更精确的数据遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练数据可能包含隐私或版权内容，数据所有者要求删除其数据。现有机器遗忘方法缺乏明确的遗忘边界，导致部分样本遗忘不足（残留泄露风险）或过度遗忘（牺牲模型效用）。

Method: 提出EAGLE-PC框架，包含两个核心组件：1）纠缠感知引导的损失重加权，通过测量样本与保留样本在嵌入空间的相似性确定遗忘力度；2）利用ICL生成测试数据的代理约束，软正则化遗忘过程防止过度遗忘。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中，EAGLE-PC在多个LLM上一致改善了遗忘-效用权衡，结合NPO+GD优化器可接近完全重新训练的性能。

Conclusion: EAGLE-PC提供了一个可扩展且鲁棒的遗忘解决方案，可作为即插即用的增强模块与现有基于梯度的目标兼容，有效解决了机器遗忘中的边界模糊问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include
private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns,
data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine
unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific
data without full retraining. However, most existing methods lack a sound
forgetting boundary, causing some samples to be under-forgotten, leaving
residual leakage risks, while others remain over-forgotten at the expense of
degraded utility.
  In this work, we propose EAGLE-PC (Entanglement-Awareness Guided Loss
Reweighting with Proxy Constraint), a novel unlearning framework that addresses
these limitations through two key components. First, entanglement-awareness
guided loss reweighting determines the forgetting effort of each sample by
measuring its similarity to retain samples in the embedding space, enabling
more targeted and effective unlearning. Second, a proxy constraint leveraging
ICL (In-Context Learning) generated test data softly regularizes the forgetting
process, effectively mitigating over-forgetting. EAGLE-PC is compatible with
existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement.
We evaluate EAGLE-PC on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, showing consistent
improvements in the forgetting-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Combined
with the NPO+GD optimizer, it approaches full retraining performance, offering
a scalable and robust unlearning solution.

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了当前方法的局限性，指出了对先进隐私保护数据共享方法的需求，并为在现实场景中评估这些方法设立了先例

Abstract: Generative AI offers transformative potential for high-stakes domains such as
healthcare and finance, yet privacy and regulatory barriers hinder the use of
real-world data. To address this, differentially private synthetic data
generation has emerged as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce a
unified benchmark to systematically evaluate the utility and fidelity of text
datasets generated under formal Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees. Our
benchmark addresses key challenges in domain-specific benchmarking, including
choice of representative data and realistic privacy budgets, accounting for
pre-training and a variety of evaluation metrics. We assess state-of-the-art
privacy-preserving generation methods across five domain-specific datasets,
revealing significant utility and fidelity degradation compared to real data,
especially under strict privacy constraints. These findings underscore the
limitations of current approaches, outline the need for advanced
privacy-preserving data sharing methods and set a precedent regarding their
evaluation in realistic scenarios.

Motivation: 现有基于图神经网络的EHR建模方法存在两个不足：1) 仅依赖成对关系无法捕捉临床数据中的高阶依赖；2) 局部消息传递机制限制了表示能力

Method: 提出Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer框架：1) 使用超图结构编码器捕捉医疗代码间的高阶交互；2) 集成Transformer架构对整个超图进行推理；3) 设计包含超图重建的损失函数以保持原始结构

Result: 在真实世界EHR数据集上的实验表明，SHGT在诊断预测任务上优于现有的最先进模型

Conclusion: SHGT框架通过超图建模和Transformer架构有效解决了EHR数据中的高阶依赖关系捕捉问题，提升了诊断预测性能

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) systematically organize patient health data
through standardized medical codes, serving as a comprehensive and invaluable
source for predictive modeling. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated
effectiveness in modeling interactions between medical codes within EHR.
However, existing GNN-based methods are inadequate due to: a) their reliance on
pairwise relations fails to capture the inherent higher-order dependencies in
clinical data, and b) the localized message-passing scheme limits
representation power. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel
Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework following three-fold
ideas: a) employing a hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order
interactions among medical codes, b) integrating the Transformer architecture
to reason over the entire hypergraph, and c) designing a tailored loss function
incorporating hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original
structure. Experiments on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
SHGT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction.

TL;DR: MedGR²是一个创新的医疗视觉语言模型框架，通过生成式奖励学习创建自我改进的良性循环，解决了医疗领域高质量标注数据稀缺的问题，实现了卓越的跨模态和跨任务泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗视觉语言模型应用受到高质量专家标注数据稀缺的严重限制，传统监督微调方法在未见模态和任务上泛化能力差，而强化学习又缺乏可靠的奖励信号。

Method: 提出MedGR²框架，协同开发数据生成器和奖励模型，自动持续生成高质量多模态医疗数据，用于监督微调和基于组相对策略优化(GRPO)的强化学习。

Result: 使用MedGR²生成数据进行监督微调已超越基于大规模人工标注数据集的基线方法；结合GRPO进行强化学习后，在跨模态和跨任务泛化方面达到最先进水平，性能超越专门的基于强化学习的方法，紧凑模型性能可与参数量10倍以上的基础模型竞争。

Conclusion: MedGR²为高风险领域的高效学习提供了新范式，将问题从数据稀缺转变为数据生成，释放了强化学习在构建真正可泛化医疗AI方面的全部潜力。

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically
hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on
unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising
alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this
data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward
Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a
self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a
reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality,
multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT
and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data
already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets.
Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and
cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based
methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves
performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more
parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in
high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data
generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly
generalizable medical AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MERIT是一种新颖的优化器，通过使用max-norm计算信任比来有效约束注意力层的最大注意力对数，解决了大批次训练中的优化和泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器如AdamW和LAMB在大批次训练语言模型时存在性能下降问题，主要由于注意力层中最大注意力对数的急剧增加造成的信息瓶颈。LAMB的l2范数信任比无法有效影响查询/键权重的最大值，且权重级信任比容易出错。

Method: 提出MERIT优化器，利用max-norm计算信任比来更有效地约束最大注意力对数，并构建元素级信任比通过关注局部权重结构提供更稳健的更新缩放。

Result: 在各种规模的GPT-2模型上进行的大批次训练实验显示MERIT具有优越性能。在GPT-2 Medium训练中，MERIT实现了6k批次大小而没有任何性能下降，相比标准批次大小(480)使用48B训练token。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了在大批次训练中考虑最大注意力对数和更细粒度信任比的重要性，成功提高了训练稳定性，为使用更大批次铺平了道路，使大型语言模型的开发和迭代更快。

Abstract: Large-batch training has become a cornerstone in accelerating the training of
deep neural networks, yet it poses challenges in optimization and
generalization. Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation
during language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck
in attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While
the LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still
face this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are
less effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.
Furthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks
relationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm
to calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more
effectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to
provide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures.
Extensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2
models demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the
training of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance
degradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens.
This work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and
finer-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves
the training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling
faster development and iteration of large language models. Code is available at

Motivation: 当前高斯过程随机超参数学习方法依赖近似计算，无法保证收敛到真实边际似然的驻点，需要开发精确的随机推理算法

Method: 针对产生中等有限维再生核希尔伯特空间(RKHS)的核函数，提出精确随机推理算法，也可扩展到无限维RKHS但会牺牲精确性

Result: 在内存资源限制批次大小和诱导点数量的情况下，无论是有限维还是无限维RKHS，该方法都取得了比现有方法更好的实验结果

Conclusion: 该方法为高斯过程随机超参数学习提供了精确的推理框架，在计算资源受限的场景下表现出优越性能

Abstract: Current methods for stochastic hyperparameter learning in Gaussian Processes
(GPs) rely on approximations, such as computing biased stochastic gradients or
using inducing points in stochastic variational inference. However, when using
such methods we are not guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the
true marginal likelihood. In this work, we propose algorithms for exact
stochastic inference of GPs with kernels that induce a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS) of moderate finite dimension. Our approach can also be
extended to infinite dimensional RKHSs at the cost of forgoing exactness. Both
for finite and infinite dimensional RKHSs, our method achieves better
experimental results than existing methods when memory resources limit the
feasible batch size and the possible number of inducing points.

Abstract: Over-squashing is a challenge in training graph neural networks for tasks
involving long-range dependencies. In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field
should be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However,
gathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its
content into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable
to bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied
remedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate
over-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global
topology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph
structure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This
study presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate
the effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global
structure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the
node centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus,
the proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with
likely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across
selected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without
adding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve
performance on graph and node classification tasks. The code can be found at

Abstract: Assessing whether a sample survey credibly represents the population is a
critical question for ensuring the validity of downstream research. Generally,
this problem reduces to estimating the distance between two high-dimensional
distributions, which typically requires a number of samples that grows
exponentially with the dimension. However, depending on the model used for data
analysis, the conclusions drawn from the data may remain consistent across
different underlying distributions. In this context, we propose a task-based
approach to assess the credibility of sampled surveys. Specifically, we
introduce a model-specific distance metric to quantify this notion of
credibility. We also design an algorithm to verify the credibility of survey
data in the context of regression models. Notably, the sample complexity of our
algorithm is independent of the data dimension. This efficiency stems from the
fact that the algorithm focuses on verifying the credibility of the survey data
rather than reconstructing the underlying regression model. Furthermore, we
show that if one attempts to verify credibility by reconstructing the
regression model, the sample complexity scales linearly with the dimensionality
of the data. We prove the theoretical correctness of our algorithm and
numerically demonstrate our algorithm's performance.

Abstract: We develop a stochastic algorithm for independent component analysis that
incorporates multi-trial supervision, which is available in many scientific
contexts. The method blends a proximal gradient-type algorithm in the space of
invertible matrices with joint learning of a prediction model through
backpropagation. We illustrate the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real

observe an increased success rate of the non-convex optimization and the
improved interpretability of the independent components.

Conclusion: MAE通过可扩展的自监督学习在超声信号分析中展现出巨大潜力，为1D信号处理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)
with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation
learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have
demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their
use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely
unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as
non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where
labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We
propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic
ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that
enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)
classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model
size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream
accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform
models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)
baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on
synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured
signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study
underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis
through scalable, self-supervised learning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information
processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function
calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based
systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them.
However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale
graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this
technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph
algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing
of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can
be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any
question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning
about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also
introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as
final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide
spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more
open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we
discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.

Method: 基于混合随机梯度跟踪和方差缩减机制，结合行随机和列随机通信方案，无需Perron向量估计或出度信息

Result: 理论分析显示TV-HSGT能在无梯度有界假设下获得改进的动态遗憾界，逻辑回归实验验证了其在动态资源受限环境中的有效性

Conclusion: TV-HSGT算法通过创新的混合梯度跟踪机制，有效解决了时变有向网络中的分布式在线优化问题

Abstract: With the increasing scale and dynamics of data, distributed online
optimization has become essential for real-time decision-making in various
applications. However, existing algorithms often rely on bounded gradient
assumptions and overlook the impact of stochastic gradients, especially in
time-varying directed networks. This study proposes a novel Time-Varying Hybrid
Stochastic Gradient Tracking algorithm named TV-HSGT, based on hybrid
stochastic gradient tracking and variance reduction mechanisms. Specifically,
TV-HSGT integrates row-stochastic and column-stochastic communication schemes
over time-varying digraphs, eliminating the need for Perron vector estimation
or out-degree information. By combining current and recursive stochastic
gradients, it effectively reduces gradient variance while accurately tracking
global descent directions. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that TV-HSGT can
achieve improved bounds on dynamic regret without assuming gradient
boundedness. Experimental results on logistic regression tasks confirm the
effectiveness of TV-HSGT in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: VarDiU通过无偏梯度估计解决了现有扩散蒸馏方法的偏差问题，显著提升了一步扩散蒸馏的性能

Abstract: Recently, diffusion distillation methods have compressed thousand-step
teacher diffusion models into one-step student generators while preserving
sample quality. Most existing approaches train the student model using a
diffusive divergence whose gradient is approximated via the student's score
function, learned through denoising score matching (DSM). Since DSM training is
imperfect, the resulting gradient estimate is inevitably biased, leading to
sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose VarDiU (pronounced
/va:rdju:/), a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound that admits an unbiased
gradient estimator and can be directly applied to diffusion distillation. Using
this objective, we compare our method with Diff-Instruct and demonstrate that
it achieves higher generation quality and enables a more efficient and stable
training procedure for one-step diffusion distillation.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enhance the efficiency and
accuracy of neural operators through self-composition, offering both
theoretical guarantees and practical benefits. Inspired by iterative methods in
solving numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), we design a specific
neural operator by repeatedly applying a single neural operator block, we
progressively deepen the model without explicitly adding new blocks, improving
the model's capacity. To train these models efficiently, we introduce an
adaptive train-and-unroll approach, where the depth of the neural operator is
gradually increased during training. This approach reveals an accuracy scaling
law with model depth and offers significant computational savings through our
adaptive training strategy. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate its efficacy on a
challenging high-frequency ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) problem, where
a multigrid-inspired backbone enables superior performance in resolving complex
wave phenomena. The proposed framework provides a computationally tractable,
accurate, and scalable solution for large-scale data-driven scientific machine
learning applications.

Conclusion: 时间序列的组合性建模能有效生成高质量的合成临床数据，缓解数据稀疏问题，并为临床时间序列的理解和预测提供新途径。

Abstract: This work investigates whether time series of natural phenomena can be
understood as being generated by sequences of latent states which are ordered
in systematic and regular ways. We focus on clinical time series and ask
whether clinical measurements can be interpreted as being generated by
meaningful physiological states whose succession follows systematic principles.
Uncovering the underlying compositional structure will allow us to create
synthetic data to alleviate the notorious problem of sparse and low-resource
data settings in clinical time series forecasting, and deepen our understanding
of clinical data. We start by conceptualizing compositionality for time series
as a property of the data generation process, and then study data-driven
procedures that can reconstruct the elementary states and composition rules of
this process. We evaluate the success of this methods using two empirical tests
originating from a domain adaptation perspective. Both tests infer the
similarity of the original time series distribution and the synthetic time
series distribution from the similarity of expected risk of time series
forecasting models trained and tested on original and synthesized data in
specific ways. Our experimental results show that the test set performance
achieved by training on compositionally synthesized data is comparable to
training on original clinical time series data, and that evaluation of models
on compositionally synthesized test data shows similar results to evaluating on
original test data, outperforming randomization-based data augmentation. An
additional downstream evaluation of the prediction task of sequential organ
failure assessment (SOFA) scores shows significant performance gains when model
training is entirely based on compositionally synthesized data compared to
training on original data.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力增强，有害微调风险增加。现有研究主要关注监督微调，但强化学习可能带来更大的安全威胁，需要专门的防御方法。

Method: 提出TokenBuncher防御方法，包含熵作为奖励的RL和Token Noiser机制，通过约束模型响应不确定性来防止RL利用奖励信号驱动有害行为。

Result: 在多模型和RL算法上的实验表明，TokenBuncher能有效缓解有害RL微调，同时保持良性任务效用和微调能力。

Conclusion: RL有害微调比SFT具有更大系统性风险，TokenBuncher提供了有效且通用的防御解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the
risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume
that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we
systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries
to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task
assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging
threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically
targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation
on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty,
RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the
model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through
entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the
escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates
harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability.
Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater
systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general
defense.

Conclusion: EEGDM通过扩散模型实现了强大的EEG表示学习能力，具有良好的泛化性和实用价值。

Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis using deep learning has
shown great promise, existing approaches still face significant challenges in
learning generalizable representations that perform well across diverse tasks,
particularly when training data is limited. Current EEG representation learning
methods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked
reconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic
information and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we
propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based
on the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a
self-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong
representation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates
an EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a
compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the
diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a
compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative
process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results
show that EEGDM (1) can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, (2) effectively
learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance with
modest pre-training data size across diverse downstream tasks, underscoring its
generalizability and practical utility.

Conclusion: 研究为工具增强的工作流程提供了理论和实证基础，证明其不仅具有实用性，而且在可扩展性方面具有可证明的优势，工具使用比纯粹的记忆方法更加高效和可扩展

Abstract: Tool-augmented language models, equipped with retrieval, memory, or external
APIs, are reshaping AI, yet their theoretical advantages remain underexplored.
In this paper, we address this question by demonstrating the benefits of
in-tool learning (external retrieval) over in-weight learning (memorization)
for factual recall. We show that the number of facts a model can memorize
solely in its weights is fundamentally limited by its parameter count. In
contrast, we prove that tool-use enables unbounded factual recall via a simple
and efficient circuit construction. These results are validated in controlled
experiments, where tool-using models consistently outperform memorizing ones.
We further show that for pretrained large language models, teaching tool-use
and general rules is more effective than finetuning facts into memory. Our work
provides both a theoretical and empirical foundation, establishing why
tool-augmented workflows are not just practical, but provably more scalable.

Conclusion: cMALC-D框架通过LLM引导的课程学习和多样性上下文混合，有效解决了多智能体强化学习在复杂不确定环境中的泛化挑战

Abstract: Many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are trained in
fixed simulation environments, making them brittle when deployed in real-world
scenarios with more complex and uncertain conditions. Contextual MARL (cMARL)
addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and
training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment
configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to
help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on
unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage
estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to
inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we
propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with
Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and
provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage
exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism
that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts.
Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D
significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to
existing curriculum learning baselines. We provide code at

Abstract: Feature transformation plays a critical role in enhancing machine learning
model performance by optimizing data representations. Recent state-of-the-art
approaches address this task as a continuous embedding optimization problem,
converting discrete search into a learnable process. Although effective, these
methods often rely on sequential encoder-decoder structures that cause high
computational costs and parameter requirements, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that
accomplishes automated feature transformation through four steps:
transformation records collection, embedding space construction with a revised
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, gradient-ascent search, and
autoregressive reconstruction. In our approach, the revised GPT model serves
two primary functions: (a) feature transformation sequence reconstruction and
(b) model performance estimation and enhancement for downstream tasks by
constructing the embedding space. Such a multi-objective optimization framework
reduces parameter size and accelerates transformation processes. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework matches or
exceeds baseline performance, with significant gains in computational
efficiency. This work highlights the potential of transformer-based
architectures for scalable, high-performance automated feature transformation.

Conclusion: ATM-GAD通过有效利用时间模式和自适应时间窗口，显著提升了金融欺诈检测的性能，能够识别传统方法难以发现的复杂欺诈模式

Abstract: Financial fraud detection is essential to safeguard billions of dollars, yet
the intertwined entities and fast-changing transaction behaviors in modern
financial systems routinely defeat conventional machine learning models. Recent
graph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks,
but they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal
motifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as
they unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when
fraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both
signals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages
temporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor
condenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs,
preserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed
by dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single
motif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step
fraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner
tailors the observation window for every node, allowing the model to focus
precisely on the most revealing time slices. Experiments on four real-world
datasets show that ATM-GAD consistently outperforms seven strong
anomaly-detection baselines, uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is ubiquitous thanks to the rapid development of
wireless technologies. However, the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions
results in great vulnerability to device authentication. Physical layer
authentication emerges as a promising approach by exploiting the unique channel
characteristics. However, a practical scheme applicable to dynamic channel
variations is still missing. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based
physical layer channel state information (CSI) authentication for mobile
scenarios and carried out comprehensive simulation and experimental evaluation
using IEEE 802.11n. Specifically, a synthetic training dataset was generated
based on the WLAN TGn channel model and the autocorrelation and the distance
correlation of the channel, which can significantly reduce the overhead of
manually collecting experimental datasets. A convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based Siamese network was exploited to learn the temporal and spatial
correlation between the CSI pair and output a score to measure their
similarity. We adopted a synergistic methodology involving both simulation and
experimental evaluation. The experimental testbed consisted of WiFi IoT
development kits and a few typical scenarios were specifically considered. Both
simulation and experimental evaluation demonstrated excellent generalization
performance of our proposed deep learning-based approach and excellent
authentication performance. Demonstrated by our practical measurement results,
our proposed scheme improved the area under the curve (AUC) by 0.03 compared to
the fully connected network-based (FCN-based) Siamese model and by 0.06
compared to the correlation-based benchmark algorithm.

TL;DR: LeMat-Traj是一个标准化的量子力学轨迹数据集，包含1.2亿个原子构型，解决了MLIP训练中数据格式不统一和获取困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习原子间势能(MLIPs)的发展受到量子力学轨迹数据集碎片化、格式不一致和获取困难的限制，这些数据集昂贵但难以整合使用。

Method: 从Materials Project、Alexandria和OQMD等大型存储库中聚合数据，标准化数据表示，协调结果并筛选高质量构型，涵盖PBE、PBESol、SCAN、r2SCAN等DFT泛函。

Result: 通过在高力数据预训练模型上使用LeMat-Traj进行微调，在弛豫任务中显著降低了力预测误差。

Conclusion: LeMat-Traj显著降低了训练可迁移和准确MLIPs的门槛，同时提供了LeMaterial-Fetcher开源库来确保数据集的可扩展性和可重现性。

Abstract: The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs)
is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of
quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory
(DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to
variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we
introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic
configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the
Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data
representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations
across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It
significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs.
LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force
structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By
fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a
significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also
present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library
developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the
community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued
evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher
are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/LeMaterial/LeMat-Traj

Abstract: While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language
processing and computer vision, their application and potential within graph
machine learning remain largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in
designing graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that
can vary across different graph datasets. Although many works on GFMs have been
focused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling
arbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed.
However, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in
the field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the
recent success of tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2, we propose G2T-FM, a
simple graph foundation model that employs TabPFNv2 as a backbone.
Specifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood
feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies TabPFNv2 to
the constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our
model achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available
GFMs and performing on par with well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover,
after finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines, highlighting the
potential of the proposed approach. More broadly, our paper reveals a
previously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for
graph machine learning tasks.

Abstract: We study a sequential resource allocation problem where a decision maker
selects subsets of agents at each period to maximize overall outcomes without
prior knowledge of individual-level effects. Our framework applies to settings
such as community health interventions, targeted digital advertising, and
workforce retention programs, where intervention effects evolve dynamically.
Agents may exhibit habituation (diminished response from frequent selection) or
recovery (enhanced response from infrequent selection). The technical challenge
centers on nonstationary reward distributions that lead to changing
intervention effects over time. The problem requires balancing two key
competing objectives: heterogeneous individual rewards and the
exploration-exploitation tradeoff in terms of learning for improved future
decisions as opposed to maximizing immediate outcomes. Our contribution
introduces the first framework incorporating this form of nonstationary rewards
in the combinatorial multi-armed bandit literature. We develop algorithms with
theoretical guarantees on dynamic regret and demonstrate practical efficacy
through a diabetes intervention case study. Our personalized community
intervention algorithm achieved up to three times as much improvement in
program enrollment compared to baseline approaches, validating the framework's
potential for real-world applications. This work bridges theoretical advances
in adaptive learning with practical challenges in population-level behavioral
change interventions.

TL;DR: DiTree是一个结合扩散策略和采样规划器的可证明泛化框架，用于动力学运动规划，在保证安全性的同时显著提高规划效率和成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决采样规划器探索速度慢和学习方法缺乏安全保证、泛化能力差的问题，结合两者的优势

Method: 将扩散策略作为知情采样器来指导状态空间搜索，结合RRT规划器和在单一环境中训练的扩散策略动作采样器

Result: 在分布外场景中，DiTree比传统采样规划器快3倍，成功率比其他方法高约30%

Conclusion: DiTree成功结合了扩散策略的复杂分布建模能力和采样规划器的完备性保证，为复杂动力学系统提供了可证明安全的解决方案

Abstract: Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free
trajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical
problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the
robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action
propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and
solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due
to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield
significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,
thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree
(DiTree): a \emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion
policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search
within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of
expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness
of SBPs to yield \emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation
iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an
implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler
trained on a \emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD
scenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than
classical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs.
DiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other
approaches by achieving roughly 30\% higher success rate. Project webpage:

Motivation: 现有检索模型主要关注查询相关性而忽视多样性，而上下文学习需要相关且多样化的示例来提高性能

Method: 1) 将ICL建模为目标选择问题，基于SMI的统一选择策略挖掘相关且多样的示例；2) 引入组合训练范式，通过新颖的基于似然的损失函数学习SMI参数；3) 使用合成生成的释义增强多跳问答数据集

Result: 在九个基准数据集上采用该检索模型和新颖的目标选择公式进行ICL，显示出显著改进

Conclusion: InSQuAD方法通过同时确保质量和多样性，有效提升了上下文学习的性能，验证了该方法的有效性

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce InSQuAD, designed to enhance the performance of
In-Context Learning (ICL) models through Submodular Mutual Information} (SMI)
enforcing Quality and Diversity among in-context exemplars. InSQuAD achieves
this through two principal strategies: First, we model the ICL task as a
targeted selection problem and introduce a unified selection strategy based on
SMIs which mines relevant yet diverse in-context examples encapsulating the
notions of quality and diversity. Secondly, we address a common pitfall in
existing retrieval models which model query relevance, often overlooking
diversity, critical for ICL. InSQuAD introduces a combinatorial training
paradigm which learns the parameters of an SMI function to enforce both quality
and diversity in the retrieval model through a novel likelihood-based loss. To
further aid the learning process we augment an existing multi-hop question
answering dataset with synthetically generated paraphrases. Adopting the
retrieval model trained using this strategy alongside the novel targeted
selection formulation for ICL on nine benchmark datasets shows significant
improvements validating the efficacy of our approach.

Abstract: Denoising-based generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching
algorithms, have achieved remarkable success. However, aligning their output
distributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences,
compositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging. While
reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL
from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to
these generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion
models and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after
fine-tuning. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models
through the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward
conditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an
inference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining
the outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our
theoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically
equivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL
objectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off
without further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG
consistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various
architectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human
preferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering.
Furthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby
offering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment. Our
approach provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing
and controlling diffusion model alignment at inference. The source code for RLG
is publicly available at the Github:

TL;DR: 本文分析了子采样自然梯度下降(SNGD)及其加速变体SPRING的理论收敛性，在线性模型和强凸二次损失函数的理想化参数优化问题中，首次为这些方法提供了理论解释和收敛保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNGD在科学机器学习中表现出色，但缺乏理论解释。本文旨在填补这一空白，分析SNGD和SPRING在理想化参数优化问题中的收敛特性。

Method: 在线性模型和强凸二次损失函数的设定下，将SNGD等价于正则化Kaczmarz方法，SPRING等价于加速正则化Kaczmarz方法，并利用现有分析工具推导收敛率。

Result: 获得了SNGD的快速收敛率、SPRING的首个收敛保证，并证明了SPRING可以加速SNGD。对于一般强凸二次损失，在更强条件下也获得了SNGD的快速收敛率。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明随机线性代数工具可以揭示子采样和曲率感知优化策略之间的相互作用，为SNGD在最小二乘设置之外的有效性提供了首个理论解释。

Abstract: Subsampled natural gradient descent (SNGD) has shown impressive results for
parametric optimization tasks in scientific machine learning, such as neural
network wavefunctions and physics-informed neural networks, but it has lacked a
theoretical explanation. We address this gap by analyzing the convergence of
SNGD and its accelerated variant, SPRING, for idealized parametric optimization
problems where the model is linear and the loss function is strongly convex and
quadratic. In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard
linear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized
Kaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized
Kaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under
mild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first
convergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that
SPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic
loss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a
fast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first
explanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting.
Overall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can
shed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware
optimization strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器学习遗忘方法需要重新训练模型，这在大型数据集上不切实际。LoTUS旨在避免重新训练，同时有效消除特定训练样本的影响。

Method: LoTUS通过平滑模型的预测概率达到信息理论边界，减轻因数据记忆导致的过度自信问题。该方法在Transformer和ResNet18模型上进行验证。

Result: 在五个公共数据集上对比八个基线方法，LoTUS在效率和效果方面都优于最先进的方法，特别是在ImageNet1k等大规模数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: LoTUS提供了一种实用的机器学习遗忘解决方案，无需重新训练即可有效消除训练样本影响，并引入了RF-JSD指标来支持真实场景下的评估。

Abstract: We present LoTUS, a novel Machine Unlearning (MU) method that eliminates the
influence of training samples from pre-trained models, avoiding retraining from
scratch. LoTUS smooths the prediction probabilities of the model up to an
information-theoretic bound, mitigating its over-confidence stemming from data
memorization. We evaluate LoTUS on Transformer and ResNet18 models against
eight baselines across five public datasets. Beyond established MU benchmarks,
we evaluate unlearning on ImageNet1k, a large-scale dataset, where retraining
is impractical, simulating real-world conditions. Moreover, we introduce the
novel Retrain-Free Jensen-Shannon Divergence (RF-JSD) metric to enable
evaluation under real-world conditions. The experimental results show that
LoTUS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and
effectiveness. Code: https://github.com/cspartalis/LoTUS.
