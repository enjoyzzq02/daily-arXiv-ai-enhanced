Abstract: As the computer vision community advances autonomous driving algorithms,
integrating vision-based insights with sensor data remains essential for
improving perception, decision making, planning, prediction, simulation, and
control. Yet we must ask: Why don't we have entirely safe self-driving cars
yet? A key part of the answer lies in addressing novel scenarios, one of the
most critical barriers to real-world deployment. Our 2COOOL workshop provides a
dedicated forum for researchers and industry experts to push the state of the
art in novelty handling, including out-of-distribution hazard detection,
vision-language models for hazard understanding, new benchmarking and
methodologies, and safe autonomous driving practices. The 2nd Workshop on the
Challenge of Out-of-Label Hazards in Autonomous Driving (2COOOL) will be held
at the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025 in Honolulu,
Hawaii, on October 19, 2025. We aim to inspire the development of new
algorithms and systems for hazard avoidance, drawing on ideas from anomaly
detection, open-set recognition, open-vocabulary modeling, domain adaptation,
and related fields. Building on the success of its inaugural edition at the
Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025, the workshop
will feature a mix of academic and industry participation.

*Alireza Golkarieh,Kiana Kiashemshaki,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种深度学习方法来分类全景X射线图像中的牙齿状况，发现结合CNN特征提取和随机森林的混合模型效果最佳，达到85.4%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发自动化系统来准确分类牙齿X光片中的常见牙科状况（填充物、蛀牙、种植体和阻生牙），以提高诊断效率和可靠性。

Method: 使用1,512张全景X射线图像和11,137个专家标注，评估三种方法：自定义CNN、CNN与传统分类器的混合模型、以及微调的预训练架构。采用5折交叉验证，使用准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数作为评估指标。

Result: 混合CNN-随机森林模型表现最佳（85.4%准确率），优于自定义CNN基线（74.3%）。预训练模型中VGG16表现最好（82.3%），其次是Xception和ResNet50。混合模型在形态相似状况的区分上表现更好。

Conclusion: CNN特征提取与集成分类器相结合为自动化牙科诊断支持提供了实用路径，但需要更大数据集和进一步临床验证。

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

### [3] [Q-Align: Alleviating Attention Leakage in Zero-Shot Appearance Transfer via Query-Query Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21090)
*Namu Kim,Wonbin Kweon,Minsoo Kim,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Align通过Query-Query对齐解决大模型零样本外观迁移中的注意力泄漏问题，在保持结构的同时提升外观保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模图像生成模型在零样本外观迁移中面临的注意力泄漏挑战，该问题源于Query-Key对齐导致的语义映射泄露

Method: 提出Q-Align方法，包含三个核心贡献：1) Query-Query对齐实现精细空间语义映射；2) Key-Value重排增强特征对应；3) 使用重排后的键值进行注意力精化保持语义一致性

Result: 通过大量实验验证，Q-Align在外观保真度方面优于最先进方法，同时保持竞争力的结构保持能力

Conclusion: Q-Align有效解决了注意力泄漏问题，为零样本外观迁移提供了更好的语义对齐和外观保真度

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

### [4] [ERTACache: Error Rectification and Timesteps Adjustment for Efficient Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21091)
*Xurui Peng,Hong Liu,Chenqian Yan,Rui Ma,Fangmin Chen,Xing Wang,Zhihua Wu,Songwei Liu,Mingbao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERTACache是一个扩散模型加速框架，通过特征缓存和误差校正实现2倍推理加速，同时保持甚至提升生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型由于迭代推理过程导致计算开销大，特征缓存虽然能加速但会造成质量下降，需要解决缓存带来的累积误差问题

Method: 提出ERTACache框架：离线残差分析识别可重用步骤、动态调整积分间隔、通过闭式残差线性化模型近似缓存误差，联合校正特征偏移误差和步长放大误差

Result: 在标准图像和视频生成基准测试中实现2倍推理加速，视觉质量保持甚至提升，在Wan2.1视频扩散模型上加速2倍且VBench退化最小

Conclusion: ERTACache通过系统性的误差分析和校正机制，成功解决了扩散模型缓存加速中的质量退化问题，实现了高效且高质量的推理

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at
https://github.com/bytedance/ERTACache.

### [5] [Video-LLMs with Temporal Visual Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21094)
*Zheyu Fan,Jiateng Liu,Yuji Zhang,Zihan Wang,Yi R.,Fung,Manling Li,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Temporal Visual Screening (TVS)任务，通过保留关键视频片段、重构查询并保持答案一致性，来提升视频大语言模型的时序语义理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型由于稀疏帧采样和缺乏帧间推理监督，难以捕捉细粒度时序语义，而人类能够通过拖动进度条进行时间筛选。

Method: 提出TVS作为模块化前端适配器任务，包括：(1)保留焦点关键视频片段，(2)同步重构查询至最直接形式并保持答案一致性，(3)保持答案的不变性和一致性。

Result: TVS在训练阶段带来7.33%的相对增益，推理阶段带来34.6%的相对增益。提出的ReSimplifyIt基线在视频修剪任务上F-1分数提升0.47。

Conclusion: TVS通过优化推理负担和认知负载分布，有效提升了视频语言理解能力，证明了时序信息筛选的重要性。

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

### [6] [ROBUST-MIPS: A Combined Skeletal Pose and Instance Segmentation Dataset for Laparoscopic Surgical Instruments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21096)
*Zhe Han,Charlie Budd,Gongyu Zhang,Huanyu Tian,Christos Bergeles,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ROBUST-MIPS数据集，将手术工具骨骼姿态标注作为更高效的标注方式，平衡语义丰富性和标注便捷性，促进标注数据的快速增长


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于深度学习的手术工具定位方法依赖分割标注，但标注数据有限。骨骼姿态标注在语义信息和标注效率之间取得更好平衡

Method: 基于现有ROBUST-MIS数据集创建ROBUST-MIPS数据集，包含工具姿态和实例分割标注。使用流行的姿态估计方法建立基准测试

Result: 姿态标注方法在手术工具定位任务中表现出高质量结果，验证了该标注方式的充分性

Conclusion: 骨骼姿态标注是手术工具定位的有效标注策略，新数据集和标注软件将促进该标注方式的采用

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

### [7] [Safe-Control: A Safety Patch for Mitigating Unsafe Content in Text-to-Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21099)
*Xiangtao Meng,Yingkai Dong,Ning Yu,Li Wang,Zheng Li,Shanqing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Safe-Control是一种即插即用的安全补丁，用于减少文本到图像生成模型中的不安全内容生成，通过数据驱动策略和安全感知条件向锁定模型注入安全控制信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型安全机制容易受到分布偏移的规避攻击，或者需要大量模型特定调整，需要一种更有效和灵活的解决方案。

Method: 使用数据驱动策略和安全感知条件，以补丁方式向锁定的T2I模型注入安全控制信号，支持构建多种安全补丁并灵活合并为统一补丁。

Result: 在六个不同的T2I模型上评估显示，Safe-Control将不安全内容生成概率降至7%，显著优于其他七种最先进的安全机制（约20%），同时保持良性图像质量和文本对齐。

Conclusion: Safe-Control作为一种即插即用的安全补丁，能有效减少T2I模型的不安全内容生成，具有出色的适应性和兼容性，优于现有安全机制。

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

*Kei Katsumata,Yui Iioka,Naoki Hosomi,Teruhisa Misu,Kentaro Yamada,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENNAV是一个用于从自然语言指令和前置摄像头图像中识别目标区域位置的新方法，特别擅长处理边界模糊的stuff-type目标区域，并在多目标和无目标情况下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理stuff-type目标区域（边界模糊）以及无目标或多目标情况时表现不佳，需要一种能够同时预测目标存在性和生成分割掩码的解决方案。

Method: 提出GENNAV方法，能够预测目标存在性并为多个stuff-type目标区域生成分割掩码。构建了GRiN-Drive新基准数据集，包含无目标、单目标和多目标三种样本类型。

Result: GENNAV在标准评估指标上优于基线方法。在四个汽车、五个不同地理位置的城市场景中进行真实世界实验，验证了其零样本迁移性能，表现出强大的跨环境鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GENNAV在处理stuff-type目标区域识别任务中表现出色，特别是在复杂真实世界环境中具有优秀的泛化能力和鲁棒性，为自动驾驶导航提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

### [9] [R-4B: Incentivizing General-Purpose Auto-Thinking Capability in MLLMs via Bi-Mode Annealing and Reinforce Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21113)
*Jie Jiang,Qi Yang,Bolin Ni,Shiming Xiang,Han Hu,Houwen Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R-4B是一种自适应思维的多模态大语言模型，能够根据问题复杂度智能决定是否启动思维过程，在保持高性能的同时减少计算冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理简单问题时也会进行冗余的逐步思维过程，导致计算效率低下。需要一种能够自适应决定是否启动思维过程的模型。

Method: 采用双模式退火训练方法，让模型同时具备思维和非思维两种能力，并通过双模式策略优化(BPO)提高模型判断是否启动思维过程的准确性。训练分为两个阶段：首先在精心策划的数据集上训练，然后在改进的GRPO框架下进行策略优化。

Result: R-4B在25个具有挑战性的基准测试中达到最先进性能，在大多数任务中优于Qwen2.5-VL-7B，在推理密集型基准上达到与更大模型相当的性能，同时计算成本更低。

Conclusion: R-4B通过自适应思维机制成功解决了多模态大语言模型在处理简单问题时的计算冗余问题，实现了性能与效率的平衡，为高效多模态推理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiddenObject是一个基于Mamba的多模态融合框架，整合RGB、热成像和深度数据，用于检测遮挡或伪装的目标，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB检测方法在遮挡、伪装和光照变化等恶劣条件下性能受限，需要更鲁棒的模态无关方法来解决多模态环境中的隐藏物体检测问题。

Method: 提出基于Mamba的融合机制，整合RGB、热成像和深度数据，识别模态特定特征并在统一表示中进行融合，以增强对遮挡或伪装目标的检测能力。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证，相比现有方法达到最先进或具有竞争力的性能，证明了融合设计的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的融合架构能显著推进多模态目标检测领域发展，特别是在视觉退化或复杂条件下，同时暴露了当前单模态和简单融合策略的关键局限性。

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

TL;DR: RadGS-Reg是一个用于椎体级CT/X射线配准的新框架，通过联合3D辐射高斯重建和3D/3D配准，解决了传统方法在空间信息丢失和域差距方面的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统"渲染和比较"方法在图像引导导航中存在空间信息丢失和域差距问题，而现有的双平面X射线3D重建方法受限于密集视图要求和噪声X射线处理困难

Method: 提出RadGS-Reg框架，包含基于学习的辐射高斯重建模块和反事实注意力学习机制，专注于噪声X射线中的椎体区域，并采用患者特异性预训练策略从模拟数据逐步适应到真实数据

Result: 在内部数据集上的实验表明，该方法在两个任务上都达到了最先进的性能，超越了现有方法

Conclusion: RadGS-Reg通过联合重建和配准的方法，有效解决了CT/X射线配准中的准确性和实时性挑战，为图像引导导航提供了更好的解决方案

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模标注的3D建筑数据集，自动生成准确且语义丰富的3D建筑模型仍面临重大挑战。受计算机视觉中合成数据成功的启发，需要创建大规模合成数据集来支持相关研究。

Method: 构建包含超过620万个合成3D住宅建筑的数据集，每个建筑通过三种模态表示：LoD 4级别的语义丰富3D线框图、对应的平面图图像和LiDAR式屋顶点云。语义注释从平面图图像中提取，包含房间、门窗信息。

Result: 成功创建了SYNBUILD-3D数据集，这是一个大规模、多样化、多模态的合成3D建筑数据集，为自动化3D建筑模型生成提供了丰富的训练资源。

Conclusion: SYNBUILD-3D数据集为开发新颖的生成式AI算法提供了基础，能够自动化创建具有语义几何一致性的LoD 4级别3D建筑模型，同时满足预定义的平面布局和屋顶几何约束。

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a
LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each
building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and
include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature,
future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that
automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined
floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric
consistency. Dataset and code samples are publicly available at

Conclusion: 该方法为径向畸变单应性估计提供了一个统一的框架，开发的求解器在速度和精度方面都表现出色，适用于各种计算机视觉任务。

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks
including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers
will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

*Zhenghao He,Sanchit Sinha,Guangzhi Xiong,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了全局概念激活向量(GCAV)框架，通过对比学习和注意力融合机制统一不同层的CAV表示，解决跨层概念不一致问题，提高概念归因的稳定性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念激活向量(CAVs)在不同层独立计算时存在不一致性，导致跨层比较不可靠，需要一种统一的概念表示方法来提高解释性。

Method: 使用对比学习对齐跨层概念表示，采用基于注意力的融合机制构建全局集成的GCAV，并提出了TGCAV方法应用于GCAV表示。

Result: 实验表明GCAV显著降低了TCAV分数的方差，保持了概念相关性，有效缓解了跨层概念不一致，增强了概念定位能力，提高了对抗扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GCAV通过整合跨层信息提供了一个更全面、可解释的框架，帮助理解深度学习模型如何编码人类定义的概念。

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code

### [15] [Generalizable Object Re-Identification via Visual In-Context Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21222)
*Zhizhong Huang,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VICP是一个新颖的视觉上下文提示框架，通过在已见类别上训练的模型直接泛化到未见的新类别，仅需上下文示例作为提示，无需参数调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ReID方法需要为每个新类别训练特定领域模型，缺乏泛化能力且需要昂贵的标注数据。自监督学习虽然减少标注需求，但难以捕捉ReID关键的身份敏感特征。

Method: 结合LLM和视觉基础模型：LLM通过任务特定提示从少量正负对中推断语义身份规则，然后指导VFM（如DINO）通过动态视觉提示提取ID判别性特征。

Result: 在ShopID10K数据集和多个ReID基准测试中，VICP在未见类别上明显优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VICP通过将LLM衍生的语义概念与VFM预训练先验对齐，实现了对新类别的泛化，消除了数据集特定重新训练的需求。

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

*Keshav Jha,William Sharp,Dominic LaBella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究使用SegResNet模型在PANTHER挑战赛的两个MRI胰腺肿瘤分割任务上进行评估，结果显示T1加权MRI任务DSC为0.56，T2加权MRI任务DSC降至0.33，表明不同MRI序列对分割性能有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺肿瘤的精确分割对诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但由于解剖变异性和数据集有限，自动化分割仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 采用SegResNet模型作为Auto3DSeg架构的一部分，在91例T1加权动脉对比增强MRI和50例T2加权MR-Linac病例上进行5折交叉验证和STAPLE集成，重点关注解剖相关感兴趣区域。

Result: 任务1（T1加权MRI）获得DSC 0.56、5mm DSC 0.73、HD95 41.1mm；任务2（T2加权MRI）性能下降，DSC 0.33、5mm DSC 0.50、HD95 20.1mm。

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了小数据集MRI胰腺肿瘤分割的挑战，不同MRI序列会引入变异性，尽管性能一般，但显示了自动化分割的潜力，强调需要更大标准化数据集来提高模型鲁棒性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

*Yidong Zhao,Peter Kellman,Hui Xue,Tongyun Yang,Yi Zhang,Yuchi Han,Orlando Simonetti,Qian Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reverse Imaging是一种基于物理原理的心脏MRI数据增强和域适应方法，通过逆向推断底层自旋属性来解决不同成像序列间的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的心脏MRI分割模型难以在不同成像序列间泛化，因为图像对比度存在显著差异。虽然成像协议不同，但相同的基本自旋属性（质子密度、T1和T2值）控制着所有获取的图像。

Method: 通过解决非线性逆问题，从观察到的MRI图像逆向推断底层自旋属性，使用自旋属性的先验分布进行正则化。通过扩散模型学习mSASHA数据集中的自旋先验，实现任意新序列的高度灵活图像合成。

Result: 该方法能够从MR图像中获得近似但有意义的自旋属性估计，提供可解释的"潜在变量"，实现高度准确的分割，跨越极大不同的图像对比度和成像协议。

Conclusion: Reverse Imaging实现了心脏MRI分割的宽谱泛化，从根本上解决了泛化问题，为跨不同成像序列的心脏MRI分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHD是一种新颖的个性化3D人体网格恢复方法，通过用户特定形状信息来提高视频中的姿态估计精度，使用点扩散变换器作为形状条件3D姿态先验来指导姿态拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HMR方法为通用性设计，在优化2D对齐时忽略了用户特定身体形状和3D姿态合理性，导致3D精度受损。

Method: 首先校准用户身体形状，然后基于该形状进行个性化姿态拟合，使用点扩散变换器实现形状条件3D姿态先验，通过点蒸馏采样损失迭代指导拟合过程。

Result: 方法不仅提高了骨盆对齐姿态精度，还改善了绝对姿态精度，且仅需合成数据训练，可作为即插即用模块增强现有3D姿态估计器性能。

Conclusion: PHD通过解耦形状校准和姿态拟合过程，有效减少对2D约束的过度依赖，实现了更准确的个性化3D人体姿态恢复。

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的基于扩散模型的3D人体姿态估计框架，通过分层时间剪枝策略在保持运动动态的同时减少计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能生成高质量3D人体姿态，但其迭代特性和多假设需求导致计算成本过高，需要更高效的解决方案

Method: 采用分层时间剪枝(HTP)策略：1)时间相关性增强剪枝(TCEP)识别关键帧；2)稀疏聚焦时间MHSA(SFT MHSA)减少注意力计算；3)掩码引导姿态令牌剪枝器(MGPTP)进行细粒度语义剪枝

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上，训练MACs减少38.5%，推理MACs减少56.8%，推理速度平均提升81.1%，同时达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 提出的HTP策略有效解决了扩散模型在3D人体姿态估计中的计算效率问题，在显著降低计算成本的同时保持了优异性能

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: Print2Volume是一个从2D指纹图像生成逼真合成OCT 3D指纹的框架，通过解决OCT数据稀缺问题来提升生物识别性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCT技术能获取高分辨率3D指纹数据，但数据采集成本高、耗时长，导致大规模数据集稀缺，阻碍了深度学习算法的发展

Method: 三阶段框架：1）2D风格转换模块将二值指纹转为灰度图像；2）3D结构扩展网络将2D图像外推为3D解剖体积；3）基于3D GAN的OCT真实感细化器添加纹理和噪声

Result: 生成了42万个合成样本，预训练识别模型后在真实小数据集上微调，将等错误率从15.62%显著降低到2.50%

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了OCT指纹数据稀缺问题，合成数据质量高，能显著提升生物识别性能

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of
high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface
structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and
time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

Result: 发布了首个此类数据集，为子宫内膜异位症的自动检测和分析提供了宝贵资源

Conclusion: GLENDA数据集将促进妇科腹腔镜手术视频分析的自动化方法发展，支持治疗规划、病例记录和教育等术后活动

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the
Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset
containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named
endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the
first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical
experts in the field.

Motivation: 手术视频记录已成为医学内窥镜领域的重要信息源，但自动内容索引（基于内容的医学视频档案搜索基础）由于特殊的视频内容仍然是一个巨大挑战。

Method: 使用区域全卷积网络进行实例感知的（1）器械分割（区分器械或背景）和（2）器械识别（识别器械类型）。

Result: 即使训练样本数量适中，也能以相当高的精度定位和分割器械区域；但确定具体器械类型仍然非常具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 手术器械分割取得了良好效果，但由于手术器械固有的高度相似性，器械类型识别仍然是当前的主要挑战。

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

Motivation: 全切片图像在AI算法开发中广泛应用，但目前缺乏标准元数据来描述图像内容，导致大规模WSI集合的人工检查效率低下，需要自动化解决方案

Method: 开发通用框架生成WSI的2D索引地图，采用三层组织结构：来源层、组织类型层和病理改变层，每个层将WSI的不同区域分配到特定类别

Conclusion: 提出的标准框架能够有效解决WSI元数据标准化问题，通过详细的组织地图提供细粒度信息，适用于大规模WSI集合的自动化内容分析和AI算法开发

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中经常出现训练时未见的新类别，需要模型增量学习新知识。现有的类增量学习方法假设增量数据集完全标注，这在实践中不现实。

Method: 使用基于置信度的伪标签替代人工标注，将伪标签集成到各种CIL方法中，通过置信度选择机制实现无标注数据的增量学习。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ImageNet100上评估性能下降，与有监督方法竞争，比state-of-the-art class-iNCD方法准确率高出5%以上，在细粒度数据集上验证了实用性，计算复杂度适合资源受限环境。

Conclusion: ICPL方法能够有效解决无标注数据的增量学习问题，在多个数据集上表现出色，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models,
but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical
settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation
between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging
discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue
representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative
model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in
ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,
large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

Conclusion: M框架为动态场景的高斯泼溅提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，在效率和渲染质量方面都取得了显著改进

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级图像描述模型，参数量仅为125M，比LLaMA-7B小56倍，性能却能与大型多模态通用模型相媲美。同时开发了Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架来解决视觉盲区问题，通过DeepLens模块提升视觉定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于多模态大语言模型计算需求高，难以在本地设备部署图像描述应用。需要开发轻量级但性能相当的专用模型来解决这一问题。

Method: 首先实现基于125M参数语言模型的轻量级专家模型，然后开发Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架，使用DeepLens模块提取详细视觉表征，专注于信息丰富的区域。

Result: 模型在单句和详细描述任务上表现优异，性能可与大型多模态通用模型相媲美。新框架有效缓解了视觉盲区问题，提升了描述质量。

Conclusion: 轻量级专家模型具有在设备端应用的潜力，Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架通过改进视觉定位机制有效解决了语义描述错误问题，为轻量级图像描述系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction
systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is
challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by
implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times
smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia
diagnosis, their integration into federated learning (FL) systems remains
underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the
impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning
strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of
federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset,
we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially
influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to
full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard
federated averaging. Our results offer practical insights for deploying FMs in
decentralized clinical settings and highlight trade-offs that should guide

Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法要么专注于单一技术家族，要么在特定类型OOD数据集上评估，忽略了组合多种现有解决方案的潜力

Method: 提出MME评分，统一最先进的OOD检测器到一个更有效的评分函数中，结合特征截断和多个评分函数的聚合

Result: 在大型和小型基准测试中，包括近OOD和远OOD场景，MME显著优于最新方法，在ImageNet-1K基准上平均FPR95达到27.57%，比现有最佳基线提升6%

Conclusion: 理论分析和实验证明，最先进的特征截断和评分函数可以有效地结合，多个评分函数的聚合增强了针对各种类型OOD样本的鲁棒性

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

Conclusion: 局部增强方法通过减少背景干扰，能够更有效地提升对抗补丁攻击效果，为船舶检测安全提供了新的防御思路

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了ELV-Halluc基准测试，专门针对长视频多模态大语言模型的语义聚合幻觉问题进行研究，发现语义复杂度增加会导致幻觉加剧，并提出位置编码和DPO策略来缓解该问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频多模态大语言模型存在幻觉问题，特别是在长视频中，语义聚合过程中会产生与视频内容不一致的输出。之前的基准测试主要关注短视频，忽视了长视频中语义复杂导致的特殊幻觉类型。

Method: 构建ELV-Halluc基准测试来系统研究语义聚合幻觉(SAH)，分析语义复杂度对幻觉的影响，并探索通过位置编码策略和DPO（直接偏好优化）方法来缓解SAH问题。

Result: 实验证实了SAH的存在，发现语义复杂度增加会导致SAH加剧，模型在快速变化的语义上更容易产生幻觉。采用位置编码和DPO策略后，在ELV-Halluc和Video-MME基准上均取得改进，SAH比率显著降低27.7%。

Conclusion: 长视频中的语义聚合幻觉是一个重要但被忽视的问题，需要专门的基准测试和方法来解决。位置编码和DPO策略能有效缓解SAH，为提升长视频理解模型的可靠性提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种卷积神经网络上采样器，用于提升基础模型特征的分辨率，以解决显微镜图像中精细特征和大尺寸图像的分割问题，在多种材料样本上实现了高效高质量的交互式分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于patch的基础模型特征在显微镜图像分析中存在两个主要问题：1）难以表示微图像中的精细特征；2）处理大尺寸图像时计算效率低。需要一种方法能够高效地提升特征分辨率以支持精确分割。

Method: 训练一个卷积神经网络，参考输入图像对低分辨率（大patch尺寸）的基础模型特征进行上采样。该上采样器无需额外训练即可应用于各种显微镜图像的特征提取和分割。

Result: 在植物细胞、锂离子电池阴极和有机晶体等多种显微镜图像上验证了方法的有效性。上采样后的丰富特征能够分离难以分割的相（如发丝裂纹），交互式分割相比传统卷积网络需要更少的标签和更快的速度就能产生高质量分割结果。

Conclusion: 该方法通过特征上采样有效解决了基础模型在显微镜图像分析中的局限性，实现了高效、高质量的图像分割，特别是在处理精细特征和大尺寸图像方面表现出色。

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

Conclusion: HCCM框架有效解决了无人机场景中的视觉语言理解挑战，无需精确场景分割和严格约束，在标准数据集和零样本泛化方面均表现出色

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text
retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned
baselines.

Conclusion: 提出的生成式方法能够有效解决单图像3D重建中的遮挡问题，相比传统回归方法在完整性和多样性方面有显著提升。

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

Result: 在多个数据集上验证：相比穷举比较减少90.5%人工标注，相比先前工作减少19.8%标注量(n=100)，同时保持或提高评分者间可靠性

Conclusion: CLIP先验与不确定性采样结合为成对排序提供了高效可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current
vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these
abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP,
and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of
fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct
such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of
street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our
synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially
for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study
introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates
synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose
models to specialized domains.

TL;DR: TFM是一种统一的生成式轨迹方法，用于4D医学图像预测，通过学习底层时间分布，支持3D体积、多先验扫描和不规则采样，在三个公共纵向数据集上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中的时间动态理解对疾病进展建模、治疗计划和解剖发育跟踪至关重要，但现有深度学习方法大多只考虑单一时间背景或专注于分类回归任务，限制了细粒度空间预测能力。

Method: 提出时间流匹配(TFM)方法，这是一种生成式轨迹方法，能够学习底层时间分布，支持3D体积、多个先验扫描和不规则采样，并能回退到最近图像预测器作为特殊情况。

Result: 在三个公共纵向数据集上的广泛基准测试表明，TFM始终超越自然成像中的时空方法，为4D医学图像预测建立了新的最先进和鲁棒的基线。

Conclusion: TFM填补了医学影像时间动态建模的重要空白，提供了一个统一的生成框架，在4D医学图像预测任务上表现出卓越性能。

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new
state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了整合术前CT和术后病理全切片图像的多模态深度学习框架，用于透明细胞肾癌复发预测。病理模型优于CT模型，中间融合进一步提升性能，接近临床基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 透明细胞肾癌复发风险评估对术后监测和治疗至关重要，但现有Leibovich评分缺乏患者级分辨率且排除影像信息。

Method: 采用模块化深度学习框架，使用预训练编码器和基于Cox的生存模型，测试单模态、晚期融合和中间融合设置。

Result: 病理模型始终优于CT模型，中间融合最佳模型(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18)接近调整后Leibovich评分。影像通过融合增加价值。

Conclusion: 证明了基于基础模型的多模态整合用于个性化ccRCC风险预测的可行性，未来需探索更具表达力的融合策略和更大数据集。

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

TL;DR: 该论文提出从单词级OCR向行级OCR的转变，通过跳过错误易发的单词分割步骤，利用更大的句子上下文来提升OCR准确率和效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OCR技术存在字符分割错误问题，现代单词级OCR虽然利用了语言模型但将瓶颈转移到了单词分割。作者观察到需要进一步发展到行级OCR来绕过单词检测错误并提供更大的句子上下文

Method: 提出行级OCR方法，直接处理整行文本而不是单个单词，创建了包含251个英文页面图像的行级标注数据集进行训练和基准测试

Result: 实验显示端到端准确率显著提升5.4%，效率相比基于单词的流程提高了4倍

Conclusion: 向行级OCR的转变不仅提高了准确率和效率，还为利用大型语言模型的进步提供了潜力，特别适用于文档图像处理

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种深度展开网络(DUN)来解决计算机生成全息术(CGH)中的非线性不适定问题，通过自适应带宽保持模型和相位域复值去噪器，实现了超过35dB的PSNR性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的CGH方法存在三个主要问题：端到端网络忽视物理关系导致可解释性差；CNN方法感受野有限难以捕捉长程依赖；基于角谱方法(ASM)的模型局限于有限近场。

Method: 提出深度展开网络(DUN)，将梯度下降分解为两个模块：自适应带宽保持模型(ABPM)和相位域复值去噪器(PCD)。ABPM支持更宽的工作距离，PCD使用复值可变形自注意力模块捕捉全局特征。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上的实验显示达到了最先进的性能，PSNR超过35dB，相比ASM方法具有更宽的工作距离范围。

Conclusion: 所提出的DUN方法通过结合物理模型和深度学习，在保持可解释性的同时显著提升了CGH的重建性能，为解决非线性不适定问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全身PET/CT是肿瘤成像的基石，但由于示踪剂异质性、生理性摄取和多中心变异性，准确的病灶分割仍然具有挑战性。临床实践需要保持人在循环中的方法来高效细化预测掩码。

Method: 基于autoPET III获胜的nnU-Net流水线，通过将用户提供的前景和背景点击编码为附加输入通道来扩展框架。系统研究空间提示表示，证明欧几里得距离变换(EDT)编码优于高斯核。提出在线模拟用户交互和自定义点采样策略。

Result: 基于EDT的模型集成（使用和不使用外部数据训练）实现了最强的交叉验证性能，与基线模型相比减少了假阳性和假阴性。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了可提示模型在多示踪剂、多中心PET/CT中实现高效用户引导分割工作流程的潜力。

Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate
lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity,
physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with
and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,
reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.
These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,
user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code

Motivation: 现有HD地图构建方法使用标准映射技术存在泛化问题，经常产生不存在的道路元素幻觉，需要更精确的映射机制

Method: 基于相机参数的几何映射，通过概率投影机制和置信度分数来细化映射并过滤无关元素，使用时序处理选择性积累可靠信息

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集的新划分上表现出优于最先进方法的性能，特别是在nuScenes和长感知距离挑战场景中改进显著

Conclusion: 提出的概率投影机制能有效提高HD地图构建的准确性和泛化能力，特别是在复杂场景和长距离感知方面

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

TL;DR: FLORA提出了一种轻量级的合成数据生成方法，使用LoRA微调Flux 1.1扩散模型，大幅降低计算需求，仅需500张合成图像就能在目标检测任务上超越需要5000张图像的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型数据增强方法需要企业级GPU和大量合成图像的高计算成本问题，使合成数据生成更加实用和易于获取。

Method: 使用Flux 1.1 Dev扩散模型，通过低秩适应（LoRA）进行微调，构建轻量级合成数据生成流程，显著降低计算需求。

Result: 在7个不同目标检测数据集上的实验表明，仅使用500张FLORA生成的合成图像就能达到比ODGEN基线使用5000张图像更好的检测性能，mAP@.50:.95提升高达21.3%。

Conclusion: FLORA证明了以质量和效率为重点的方法比暴力生成更有效，仅使用10%的数据和一小部分计算成本就能达到最先进性能，使高级合成数据创建更加实用和易于获取。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data
creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性攻击检测方法需要昂贵的重新训练、修改网络架构或降低干净输入的性能，需要一种无需修改模型即可实时检测对抗性输入的方法。

Method: 使用并行熵监控技术，在VGG-16网络的早期卷积层监测激活熵的变化，检测对抗性扰动引起的熵特征偏移。

Result: 对抗性输入使早期卷积层的激活熵一致性地偏移7%，实现了90%的检测准确率，假阳性和假阴性率均低于20%，干净和对抗性输入的熵分布完全分离。

Conclusion: CNN的可靠性可以通过激活熵单独评估，这为实时检测对抗性输入的自诊断视觉系统提供了实用部署方案，且不影响原始模型性能。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在数字测量设备读数任务中表现不佳，特别是在存在遮挡、杂乱背景、极端视角和运动模糊的真实场景中。这些挑战在头戴式摄像头和增强现实应用中尤为常见。

Method: 开发CAD2DMD-SET合成数据生成工具，利用3D CAD模型、高级渲染和高保真图像合成技术，生成多样化的VQA标注合成DMD数据集。同时创建包含1000张真实图像的DMDBench验证集。

Result: 使用平均归一化Levenshtein相似度(ANLS)对三个最先进的LVLM进行基准测试，使用CAD2DMD-SET生成的数据集微调LoRA后，InternVL模型得分提高了200%，且在其他任务上性能没有下降。

Conclusion: CAD2DMD-SET训练数据集显著提高了LVLM在挑战性条件下的鲁棒性和性能，该工具将作为开源发布，允许社区添加不同的测量设备并生成自己的数据集。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,
SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other
self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.
Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment
and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative
audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of
the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有域泛化评估对基础模型如CLIP不够挑战性，因为其预训练数据可能已覆盖许多基准测试。需要更好地评估CLIP在真实未见数据场景下的性能。

Method: 提出CLIP-DCA方法：1）使用单独领域头识别和增强CLIP编码器中的领域感知；2）通过合成多样化领域数据；3）鼓励从领域特征中分离实现领域不变分类。

Result: CLIP-DCA在更具挑战性的评估中相比现有方法显示出显著改进，特别是在更OOD的数据集上表现更好。

Conclusion: 增强领域感知是基础模型实现有效领域不变分类的前提，CLIP-DCA通过分离领域感知和分类功能成功提升了域泛化性能。

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more
OOD.

Motivation: 人类在开放世界中面对罕见新概念时表现出卓越的泛化和发现能力，而现有研究主要关注封闭集中的典型数据。本文旨在探索非典型异常视频数据如何促进开放世界学习。

Method: 收集包含各种非典型视频数据（如科幻、动画等）的新数据集，将其加入模型训练过程进行表征学习，并在三个关键开放世界学习任务上进行评估：OOD检测、新类别发现和零样本动作识别。

Result: 实验表明：1）加入非典型数据能一致提升各任务性能；2）增加非典型样本的类别多样性进一步提升OOD检测性能；3）在新类别发现任务中，使用较小但语义更多样的非典型数据集比使用更大但更典型的数据集效果更好；4）在零样本动作识别中，非典型视频的语义多样性帮助模型更好地泛化到未见动作类别。

Conclusion: 非典型视频对开放世界视觉表征学习具有显著益处，新提出的数据集鼓励该方向的进一步研究。

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the
open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

TL;DR: 提出无监督视频持续学习(uVCL)新场景，使用无标签视频数据通过核密度估计和动态记忆扩展实现连续任务学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注有监督持续学习，需要标签和任务边界信息，而实际应用中获取标签成本高且不实用。视频数据具有丰富的时空信息，但在无监督持续学习领域尚未充分探索

Method: 使用无监督视频transformer网络提取深度嵌入特征，通过核密度估计构建非参数概率表示，引入新颖性检测标准动态扩展记忆簇，利用迁移学习从先前任务传递知识

Result: 在UCF101、HMDB51和Something-to-Something V2三个标准视频动作识别数据集上进行了深入评估，不使用任何标签或类别边界，显著提升了模型在连续学习多个任务时的性能

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了无监督视频持续学习的挑战，为处理复杂视频数据提供了一种非参数学习解决方案，在连续任务学习中表现出优越性能

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

TL;DR: 基于nnU-Net框架，采用多阶段级联预训练策略，通过数据增强和模型集成方法，在胰腺导管腺癌MRI分割任务中取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌MRI自动分割面临肿瘤-组织对比度差和标注数据稀缺的挑战，需要开发在有限数据下高性能的专门模型。

Method: 使用nnU-Net框架，采用深度多阶段级联预训练策略：从通用解剖基础模型开始，依次在CT胰腺病变数据集和目标MRI模态上微调。通过五折交叉验证评估数据增强方案和训练计划，构建定制化的异构专家模型集成。

Result: 在Task 1中实现了最先进的MASD 5.46 mm和HD95 17.33 mm边界精度，交叉验证肿瘤Dice得分Task 1为0.661，Task 2为0.523。

Conclusion: 提出了一种在有限数据和复杂医学成像任务中开发专门高性能模型的稳健方法，度量感知集成策略被证明非常有效。

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现优异，在多项选择题测试中准确率达到92.8%，显著优于GPT-4和GPT-3.5，在真实临床场景中生成的放疗方案也获得较高评价，但仍需专家监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估专门针对肿瘤学优化的新型大语言模型GPT-5在放射肿瘤学临床决策支持中的性能表现，为临床应用提供依据。

Method: 使用两个基准测试：300道ACR放射肿瘤学培训考试选择题和60个真实放射肿瘤学临床案例。四位认证放射肿瘤学家对GPT-5生成的放疗方案进行正确性、全面性和幻觉评估。

Result: GPT-5在选择题测试中准确率92.8%，显著优于GPT-4(78.8%)和GPT-3.5(62.1%)。在临床案例中，正确性评分3.24/4，全面性评分3.59/4，幻觉罕见但存在实质性错误。

Conclusion: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现优异，但生成的临床建议仍需严格的专家监督，在需要精确试验知识或详细临床适应的复杂场景中仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法主要依赖精心设计的图像特征提取器和记忆库来捕捉对象间的逻辑关系，但在正常数据有限的情况下，逻辑异常检测仍然具有挑战性

Method: 提出三记忆库框架：1）类级文本记忆库用于逻辑异常检测；2）对象级图像记忆库保持完整对象轮廓；3）补丁级记忆库用于结构异常检测。通过多级检索和比较计算异常分数

Result: 在7个公开数据集（工业和医疗领域）上实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 通过协作记忆库统一结构和逻辑异常检测，TMUAD框架有效解决了正常数据有限情况下的异常检测挑战

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at
https://github.com/SIA-IDE/TMUAD.

Motivation: 视频理解需要细粒度定位掩码和详细语义属性，但获取此类数据既繁琐又昂贵，因此需要开发能够同时处理多种任务的模型并创建合适的训练数据集。

Method: 通过预处理带有真实掩码的视频来突出感兴趣对象，使用大型视觉语言模型生成伪对象描述，创建SAV-Caption数据集，并在该数据集与其他图像视频数据集上大规模训练VoCap模型。

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made
available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/vocap.

Motivation: 现有方法将动词分类视为单标签问题，但研究发现视觉事件识别存在固有模糊性，同一图像可能被多个动词类别合理描述，需要重新审视这一问题的本质。

Method: 提出将动词分类重新表述为单正例多标签学习(SPMLL)问题，开发了Graph Enhanced Verb Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP)模型，结合图神经网络捕捉标签相关性和对抗训练优化决策边界。

Result: 在真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在MAP指标上取得了超过3%的提升，同时在传统的top-1和top-5准确率指标上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 动词分类本质上是多标签问题，提出的SPMLL框架和GE-VerbMLP模型有效解决了标注数据不足的挑战，为场景识别任务提供了新的研究视角和解决方案。

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

TL;DR: DriveQA是一个全面的开源文本和视觉基准测试，用于评估LLM和MLLM在驾驶知识测试中的表现，发现现有模型在数值推理、复杂路权场景等方面存在显著弱点，但通过微调可以显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶基准测试主要关注空间和视觉问答任务，但缺乏对交通规则、标志和路权原则的全面理解。人类驾驶员需要识别现实数据集中罕见的边缘案例，因此需要建立一个全面的驾驶知识测试基准。

Method: 提出了DriveQA基准测试，包含文本和视觉模态，全面覆盖交通规则和场景。通过实验评估最先进的LLM和MLLM模型，并进行微调实验，还创建了DriveQA-V变体来测试模型对环境因素（光照、视角、距离、天气）的敏感性。

Result: 1) SOTA模型在基本交通规则上表现良好，但在数值推理、复杂路权场景、交通标志变体和空间布局方面存在显著弱点；2) 在DriveQA上微调可提高多个类别的准确性，特别是在监管标志识别和交叉口决策方面；3) DriveQA-V揭示了模型对环境因素的敏感性；4) 在DriveQA上预训练可提升下游驾驶任务性能，在nuScenes和BDD等真实数据集上取得更好结果。

Conclusion: DriveQA是一个有效的基准测试，能够全面评估模型对驾驶知识的理解。微调和预训练可以显著提升模型性能，证明模型能够内化文本和合成交通知识，并在下游QA任务中有效泛化。

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on
basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning
and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial
layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple
categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection
decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into
model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,
distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances
downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world
datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can
internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively
across downstream QA tasks.

Motivation: 深度学习模型容易学习训练数据中的虚假相关性，导致性能下降和泛化能力差，需要解决多偏见问题和增强分布外鲁棒性

Method: 提出CoBA框架：将文本分解为主谓宾三元组，选择性修改这些三元组来破坏虚假相关性，然后重构文本生成反偏见数据

Result: 实验表明CoBA不仅能提升下游任务性能，还能有效减少偏见并增强分布外鲁棒性

Conclusion: CoBA提供了一个通用且鲁棒的解决方案，能够同时应对多种偏见挑战并解决虚假相关性带来的问题

Abstract: Deep learning models often learn and exploit spurious correlations in
training data, using these non-target features to inform their predictions.
Such reliance leads to performance degradation and poor generalization on
unseen data. To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of
counterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which
simultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and
enhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias
Augmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level:
first decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively
modifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the
text from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that
mitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
CoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively
reduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a
versatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations.

with funk, a German public service content network, this research introduces
the first large-scale German dataset annotated for toxicity and enriched with
platform-provided age estimates. The dataset includes 3,024 human-annotated and
30,024 LLM-annotated anonymized comments from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
To ensure relevance, comments were consolidated using predefined toxic
keywords, resulting in 16.7\% labeled as problematic. The annotation pipeline
combined human expertise with state-of-the-art language models, identifying key
categories such as insults, disinformation, and criticism of broadcasting fees.
The dataset reveals age-based differences in toxic speech patterns, with
younger users favoring expressive language and older users more often engaging
in disinformation and devaluation. This resource provides new opportunities for
studying linguistic variation across demographics and supports the development
of more equitable and age-aware content moderation systems.

Result: LLM像人类一样受锚定效应影响；推理模型较不易受锚定效应影响，长思维链能减轻该效应；人格特质与锚定效应敏感性无显著相关。

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于深入理解LLM的认知偏差，促进LLM在社会中安全负责任的应用。

Abstract: Cognitive biases, well-studied in humans, can also be observed in LLMs,
affecting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper investigates
the anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we
instructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated
negotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric.
Experimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like
humans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring
effect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that
reasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the
long chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant
correlation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring
effect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases
in LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in
society.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Percept-V数据集，包含7200张程序生成的图像，测试多模态大语言模型在基本视觉感知任务上的表现。实验发现即使是最先进的模型在简单感知任务上也表现不佳，且性能随问题复杂度增加而显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估多模态大语言模型在基本视觉感知任务上的表现，现有研究主要关注复杂任务如编码、数学和科学，而缺乏对简单感知能力的系统测试。

Method: 创建Percept-V数据集，包含30个类别共7200张程序生成的图像，测试不同复杂度的视觉感知技能。在GPT-4o、Gemini、Claude等先进MLLM和LRM模型上进行测试。

Result: 实验结果显示所有测试模型在基本感知任务上表现不佳，性能随问题复杂度增加而显著下降。不同模型在各类别上表现出相似的趋势，某些认知技能比其他技能更难。

Conclusion: 即使是最先进的多模态大语言模型在简单视觉感知任务上也存在明显缺陷，这表明当前模型在基础感知能力方面仍有待改进。

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers
like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have
been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over
uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To
address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a
total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each
testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed
datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test
the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on
state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their
performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,
our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with
increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the
performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in
accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some
skills to be more difficult than others.

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is
represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress
is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a
comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs
as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We
formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of
scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and
domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general
natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs,
from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse
scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270
pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands --
heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require
representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal
reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a
shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with
advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent
issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving
semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline
a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on
Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving
knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building
trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在评估文本时存在显著标签偏见，ChatGPT、Gemini和Claude的评估结果受到模型标签的强烈影响，虚假标签可导致排名反转和评分大幅变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型越来越多地用于评估任务，需要了解其评估判断是否受到模型身份标签的影响，以确保评估的公平性和准确性。

Method: 使用ChatGPT、Gemini和Claude三种模型，在无标签、真实标签和两种虚假标签条件下，通过整体偏好投票和三个质量维度（连贯性、信息性、简洁性）的百分比评分来评估博客文章。

Result: 结果显示明显的非对称偏见："Claude"标签总能提升分数，"Gemini"标签总是降低分数；虚假标签经常导致排名反转，偏好投票变化达50个百分点，质量评分变化达12个百分点；Gemini在真实标签下自评分崩溃，Claude的自偏好增强。

Conclusion: 感知到的模型身份会严重扭曲高级判断并微妙影响详细质量评分，强调需要盲评或多模型评估协议来确保LLM基准测试的公平性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet
their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and
cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions:
no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by
each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and
quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all
scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking
asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini"
label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels
frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in
preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings.
Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's
self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity
can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality
ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to
ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

<details>

Motivation: 提升大语言模型从用户或其他外部来源智能、自适应地收集信息的能力，使其成为有效的多轮对话代理并与外部环境交互

Method: 基于顺序贝叶斯实验设计框架，迭代选择最大化期望信息增益的问题，使用从LLM信念分布导出的概率模型，并包含EIG估计器、上下文更新策略和候选查询生成策略等创新

Result: 在20问题游戏和用户偏好推断等广泛测试中，相比直接提示和其他自适应设计策略，BED-LLM实现了显著的性能提升

Conclusion: BED-LLM为LLM提供了一种原则性的信息收集框架，通过贝叶斯实验设计方法有效提升了模型在多轮对话中的智能信息获取能力

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from
a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn
conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments.
Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large
Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that
maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given
the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a
principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief
distribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its
construction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific
innovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely
relying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a
targeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM
achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on
the 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences,
compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

Method: 使用强化学习GRPO微调Llama-3.1 8B语言模型，结合多组件奖励系统和合成数据生成技术解决类别不平衡问题

Result: 模型性能显著提升：精确匹配准确率从0.04提高到0.18（提升350%），部分匹配准确率达到0.88，超越GPT-5-mini和Gemini-2.5-fiash等先进模型

Conclusion: 领域优化的较小模型可为关键安全分析提供计算效率更高且性能更好的解决方案，支持在资源受限的边缘设备上进行低延迟部署

Abstract: Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for
preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors
Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and
consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification
framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B
language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system
tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation
to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized
model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact
match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy
of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art
LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key
metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS
classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the
advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work
validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally
efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes
powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

Motivation: 自回归语言模型容易受到多语言字符的正字法攻击，导致性能显著下降，这主要源于子词分词器的词汇表外问题

Method: 用基于像素的表征替换基于文本的嵌入，将单词渲染为单个图像，提供对噪声输入的更强鲁棒性并扩展多语言文本兼容性

Result: 在多语言LAMBADA数据集、WMT24数据集和SST-2基准测试中验证了方法对正字法噪声的鲁棒性和在多语言环境中的有效性

Conclusion: 像素基础的生成语言模型能有效解决文本模型的字符攻击脆弱性问题，同时支持多语言书写系统

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks, where
input text is perturbed with characters from multilingual alphabets, leading to
substantial performance degradation. This vulnerability primarily stems from
the out-of-vocabulary issue inherent in subword tokenizers and their
embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a pixel-based generative
language model that replaces the text-based embeddings with pixel-based
representations by rendering words as individual images. This design provides
stronger robustness to noisy inputs, while an extension of compatibility to
multilingual text across diverse writing systems. We evaluate the proposed
method on the multilingual LAMBADA dataset, WMT24 dataset and the SST-2
benchmark, demonstrating both its resilience to orthographic noise and its
effectiveness in multilingual settings.

Motivation: 探索自监督语音模型是否像人类一样表现出关键期效应，即第二语言学习起始时间越晚难度越大，第一语言接触结束时间越晚保持越好。

Method: 在儿童导向语音数据上训练自监督语音模型，控制第二语言训练起始时间和第一语言训练结束时间，评估模型的音位辨别性能。

Result: 自监督语音模型未显示出明显的音位习得关键期效应，延迟第二语言接触起始的模型在第二语言上表现更好，延迟第一语言接触结束导致第一语言遗忘。

Conclusion: 自监督语音模型在音位层面未重现人类语言习得的关键期效应，表明当前模型与人类语言学习机制存在差异。

Abstract: This paper investigates whether the Critical Period (CP) effects in human
language acquisition are observed in self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). CP
effects refer to greater difficulty in acquiring a second language (L2) with
delayed L2 exposure onset, and greater retention of their first language (L1)
with delayed L1 exposure offset. While previous work has studied these effects
using textual language models, their presence in speech models remains
underexplored despite the central role of spoken language in human language
acquisition. We train S3Ms with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training
offsets on child-directed speech and evaluate their phone discrimination
performance. We find that S3Ms do not exhibit clear evidence of either CP
effects in terms of phonological acquisition. Notably, models with delayed L2
exposure onset tend to perform better on L2 and delayed L1 exposure offset
leads to L1 forgetting.

Result: 实验显示DMP实现高达3倍的速度提升，同时保持AUROC性能不变

Conclusion: DMP能有效加速多响应生成，且与模型、数据集、解码策略和自一致性基线正交，有望扩展到对齐和推理任务

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both
research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with
hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on
sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While
self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high
computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the
first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested
as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer
tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation
through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the
model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP
consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds
promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments
show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC
performance.

TL;DR: 本文通过'正常性'概念重新审视图灵测试，认为图灵测试针对的是正常/平均而非卓越的人类智能，需要机器表现出像普通人一样的错误和不完美行为。同时，图灵测试是统计测试，需要由陪审团而非单个平均法官进行判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视图灵测试的理论基础，探讨其对人工智能发展的指导意义，特别是针对当前大型语言模型如ChatGPT的发展方向提出批判性思考。

Method: 通过概念分析和哲学论证，从统计学角度解读图灵测试中的'正常性'概念，包括测试对象的正常智能和评判者的正常判断两个方面。

Result: 提出图灵测试实际上是测试正常智能，由代表多个评判者平均判断的正常法官进行评估。认为ChatGPT等模型追求的是卓越智能而非正常智能，因此属于'人工聪明'而非真正的人工智能。

Conclusion: 图灵测试能否促进对人类认知的理解，关键在于人类心智是否真的可简化为正常/平均心智，这个问题超越了图灵测试本身，质疑了其所依赖的正常主义范式的概念基础。

Abstract: This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of
normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the
normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense
of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two
ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather
than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test
requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior
just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a
statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a
single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As
such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his
original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical
abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of
multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of
normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average
judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,
it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the
Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than
normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it
proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per
se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can
contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether
the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which
largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual
underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.

Motivation: 自动文本摘要评估中存在严重的可复现性问题，文献中报告的性能指标与实际实验结果存在较大差距，需要建立一个公平透明的评估框架来系统分析不同评估方法的可靠性。

Method: 建立了一个统一的开源评估框架，在SummEval数据集上对六种代表性评估指标（从经典ROUGE到最新的LLM-based方法如G-Eval、SEval-Ex）进行了系统性实验比较。

Result: 研究发现评估指标存在结构性权衡：与人类判断对齐度最高的指标往往计算密集且在不同运行中稳定性较差。LLM评估方法存在随机性、技术依赖性和有限的可复现性等关键问题。

Conclusion: 需要建立更稳健的评估协议，包括详尽的文档记录和方法论标准化，以确保自动摘要评估的更大可靠性，同时要谨慎对待LLM在评估中的应用。

Abstract: This paper investigates reproducibility challenges in automatic text
summarization evaluation. Based on experiments conducted across six
representative metrics ranging from classical approaches like ROUGE to recent
LLM-based methods (G-Eval, SEval-Ex), we highlight significant discrepancies
between reported performances in the literature and those observed in our
experimental setting. We introduce a unified, open-source framework, applied to
the SummEval dataset and designed to support fair and transparent comparison of
evaluation metrics. Our results reveal a structural trade-off: metrics with the
highest alignment with human judgments tend to be computationally intensive and
less stable across runs. Beyond comparative analysis, this study highlights key
concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation, stressing their randomness,
technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility. We advocate for more
robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and
methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic
summarization assessment.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型作为自动评审生成器时，无法有效检测研究逻辑缺陷，即使论文存在明显逻辑错误，生成的评审内容也不受影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地被用作完全自动化的评审生成器，需要了解其在检测研究逻辑缺陷这一核心评审技能上的具体能力和局限性，以避免对科学完整性造成风险

Method: 提出了一个完全自动化的反事实评估框架，在受控条件下隔离和测试LLMs检测研究逻辑缺陷的能力，测试了多种ARG方法

Result: 与预期相反，研究发现研究逻辑中的缺陷对LLMs生成的评审输出没有显著影响，模型无法有效识别逻辑错误

Conclusion: 基于研究发现提出了三项可操作的建议，并公开了反事实数据集和评估框架，为未来工作提供指导

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support
scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review
generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose
significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on
a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting
faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency
between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully
automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this
skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find
that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant
effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three
actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual
dataset and evaluation framework publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在医疗应用中潜力巨大，但需要高度准确、上下文敏感且专业对齐的响应。目前缺乏专门针对临床需求的医疗奖励模型评估基准，现有基准主要关注通用能力或模型作为求解器的评估。

Method: 构建Med-RewardBench基准，采用三步严格流程确保高质量评估数据，涵盖13个器官系统和8个临床科室的1026个专家标注案例，在6个临床关键维度上进行评估。

Result: 评估了32个最先进的多模态大语言模型（包括开源、专有和医疗专用模型），发现模型输出与专家判断之间存在显著对齐挑战。开发的基线模型通过微调显示出显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: Med-RewardBench填补了医疗奖励模型评估的空白，揭示了当前模型在医疗场景中的局限性，为开发更可靠的医疗AI系统提供了重要基准和方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and
medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs
with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种解耦连续语义表示模型(DCSRM)，从大语言模型词嵌入中分解出多个子嵌入，识别可解释的语义子维度，并通过脑成像验证其神经合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义维度分析方法往往依赖预定义的粗粒度维度，忽略了更精细的概念区分，需要开发能够揭示语义结构更细致维度的新方法。

Method: 开发DCSRM模型，将LLM词嵌入分解为多个子嵌入，每个编码特定语义信息；使用体素编码模型将这些子维度映射到大脑激活模式。

Result: 识别出一组可解释的语义子维度，发现语义维度按不同原则结构化，极性是驱动分解的关键因素；神经相关性分析支持了这些子维度的认知和神经科学合理性。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了更细粒度的可解释语义子维度，深化了对概念语义组织方式的理解，为语言和大脑中意义组织机制的研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Understanding the core dimensions of conceptual semantics is fundamental to
uncovering how meaning is organized in language and the brain. Existing
approaches often rely on predefined semantic dimensions that offer only broad
representations, overlooking finer conceptual distinctions. This paper proposes
a novel framework to investigate the subdimensions underlying coarse-grained
semantic dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous
Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from
large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific
semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of
interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we
apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain
activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic
subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic
dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity
emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions. The
neural correlates of the identified subdimensions support their cognitive and
neuroscientific plausibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型意识形态立场的稳定性和深度，验证表面回应是否反映内在一致的政治立场

Method: 采用双重方法：1)通过指令提示和激活引导测量模型的可操纵性；2)使用稀疏自编码器探测内部机制，分析政治特征

Result: 发现抗操纵性强的模型包含7.3倍多的政治特征，针对性消融能导致逻辑一致的推理转变，而浅层模型仅增加拒绝输出

Conclusion: 意识形态深度是大语言模型的可量化属性，可操纵性为理解其潜在政治架构提供了重要窗口

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated pronounced ideological
leanings, yet the stability and depth of these positions remain poorly
understood. Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple
prompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent
underlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of "ideological depth"
in LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political
representations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the
"steerability" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting
and activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch
between liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an
increased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.
Second, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower
steerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our
evaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than
another model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core
political feature in an ideologically "deep" model, leading to consistent,
logical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same
intervention in a "shallow" model results in an increase in refusal outputs.
Our findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs
and that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political
architecture.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出两种AI驱动的奖励策略，通过RLAIF框架提升7B参数小语言模型的中文创意写作能力，特别是问候语生成。基于原则的LLM-as-a-Judge方法在生成质量、训练效率和减少人工标注依赖方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然创意写作能力强但计算需求大，小语言模型通过监督微调缺乏新颖性，RLHF成本高昂，需要寻找更有效的创意写作增强方法。

Method: 采用RLAIF框架，探索两种AI奖励策略：1）基于多智能体拒绝采样框架训练的奖励模型；2）通过对抗训练优化的原则指导LLM-as-a-Judge方法直接提供奖励信号。

Result: 两种方法都显著提升了创意输出，但原则指导的LLM-as-a-Judge方法在生成质量上表现更优，训练效率更高，减少了对人工标注数据的依赖。

Conclusion: 原则指导的LLM-as-a-Judge方法为创意小语言模型提供了更可扩展和有效的路径，自动化评估方法与人类判断高度一致。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing
capabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread
use. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but
current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper
explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement
Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a
7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first
strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a
novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The
second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose
reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a
reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative
output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields
superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in
training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting
a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated
evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments. Our code

Motivation: 心理偏见使人们容易相信和传播假新闻，集成方法虽然有效但依赖分类器多样性，而现有方法难以选择真正多样化的模型。

Method: 计算分类器间成对多样性，应用层次聚类分组，在不同粒度层次选择代表不同多样性的分类器池，结合性能指标选择最优池构建集成。

Result: 在6个数据集上的实验表明，该方法在2个数据集上达到最高准确率，优于Elbow启发式和现有基线方法。

Conclusion: HierarchySelect方法能有效选择多样化分类器构建集成系统，提升假新闻检测性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals
particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media,
leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and
politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied
to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly
effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However,
their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent
classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge,
especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we
propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes
diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise
diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize
them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then
explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level,
each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is
identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection
process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's
performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct
experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from
different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method
is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results
show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的数据选择和数据合成方法存在静态数据集管理的局限性，无法适应不断演变的模型能力，需要动态的数据优化框架

Method: 建立闭环优化系统：1)自我诊断模块通过三轴模型信号识别次优样本；2)自适应优化引擎将次优样本转化为教学价值高的训练点；3)通过动态学习原则持续优化

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法平均提高7.15%的准确率，同时保持原始数据集规模，显著提升种子数据质量和LLM性能

Conclusion: 这项工作通过数据和模型的动态人机协同演化，为可持续的LLM训练建立了新范式

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely
on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two
common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face
limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed
dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and
context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off
filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop
optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively
identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns
(complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores
(quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal
samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic
integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model
capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our \method consistently enhances the quality of
seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on
average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a
new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution
of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多地融入日常工作流程，需要了解不同性格特质的用户是否对特定LLM有系统性偏好。

Method: 对32名参与者（均匀分布在4种Keirsey性格类型）进行研究，评估他们与GPT-4和Claude 3.5在数据分析、创意写作、信息检索和写作协助四个协作任务中的互动。

Result: 理性型强烈偏好GPT-4（特别是目标导向任务），理想型偏爱Claude 3.5（特别是创意和分析任务），其他性格类型偏好取决于具体任务。情感分析确认了这些模式。

Conclusion: 基于性格的分析揭示了传统评估方法无法发现的LLM差异，尽管总体有用性评分相似，但性格驱动的偏好差异显著。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into everyday
workflows, where users shape outcomes through multi-turn collaboration, a
critical question emerges: do users with different personality traits
systematically prefer certain LLMs over others? We conducted a study with 32
participants evenly distributed across four Keirsey personality types,
evaluating their interactions with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four
collaborative tasks: data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval,
and writing assistance. Results revealed significant personality-driven
preferences: Rationals strongly preferred GPT-4, particularly for goal-oriented
tasks, while idealists favored Claude 3.5, especially for creative and
analytical tasks. Other personality types showed task-dependent preferences.
Sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback confirmed these patterns. Notably,
aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models, showing how
personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations
miss.

Abstract: We present QZhou-Embedding, a general-purpose contextual text embedding model
with exceptional text representation capabilities. Built upon the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model, we designed a unified multi-task
framework comprising specialized data transformation and training strategies.
The data transformation scheme enables the incorporation of more diverse
textual training datasets, while the task-specific training strategies enhance
model learning efficiency. We developed a data synthesis pipeline leveraging
LLM API, incorporating techniques such as paraphrasing, augmentation, and hard
negative example generation to improve the semantic richness and sample
difficulty of the training set. Additionally, we employ a two-stage training
strategy, comprising initial retrieval-focused pretraining followed by
full-task fine-tuning, enabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities
based on robust retrieval performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
results on the MTEB and CMTEB benchmarks, ranking first on both leaderboards

Motivation: 误导性可视化图表是社交媒体和网络上错误信息的重要来源，违反图表设计原则会扭曲数据并导致读者得出错误结论。现有AI模型训练和评估缺乏大规模、多样化且公开可用的数据集。

Method: 创建Misviz基准数据集（2604个真实可视化图表，标注12种误导类型）和Misviz-synth合成数据集（81,814个使用Matplotlib生成的图表）。使用最先进的多模态大语言模型、基于规则的系统以及微调分类器进行全面评估。

Result: 研究结果显示，检测误导性可视化图表的任务仍然极具挑战性。

Conclusion: 发布了Misviz、Misviz-synth数据集和相关代码，为检测误导性可视化图表的研究提供了重要资源，但该领域仍面临重大挑战。

Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social
media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and
lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both
humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by
such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and
identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers
and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation
of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly
available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604
real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support
model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814
visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables.
We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art
MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that
the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the
accompanying code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)在适应大语言模型时存在跷跷板现象，即某些任务的提升会以其他任务的性能下降为代价

Method: 首先独立微调每个任务识别核心参数区域，按区域重叠分组任务，然后通过参数移植和球面线性插值融合参数，最后使用混合任务数据进行轻量级流水线训练

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中显著减轻了任务干扰和遗忘问题，持续优于传统的多任务和多阶段微调基线

Conclusion: CPI-FT框架通过核心参数隔离和智能融合有效解决了多任务微调中的性能权衡问题

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a pivotal approach to adapting large language
models (LLMs) for downstream tasks; however, performance often suffers from the
``seesaw phenomenon'', where indiscriminate parameter updates yield progress on
certain tasks at the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel \emph{Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning} (CPI-FT) framework.
Specifically, we first independently fine-tune the LLM on each task to identify
its core parameter regions by quantifying parameter update magnitudes. Tasks
with similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming
clusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique:
for each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are
directly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from
different tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation
(SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT
training phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing
core regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
significantly alleviates task interference and forgetting, consistently

TL;DR: MENTAT方法通过批量反射提示优化和神经集成学习，在推理密集型回归任务中相比冻结LLM提示和Transformer编码器微调取得了65%的性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI研究者和实践者越来越多地将大语言模型应用于推理密集型回归任务，这类任务需要从文本中推断细微的数值属性，但现有方法在有限的任务特定训练数据和计算资源下表现不佳

Method: 提出了MENTAT方法，结合批量反射提示优化和神经集成学习，在三个现实问题构建的基准测试上进行验证

Result: MENTAT相比冻结LLM提示和Transformer编码器微调两种基线方法，性能提升最高达65%

Conclusion: 虽然MENTAT在推理密集型回归任务上取得了显著改进，但该领域仍有很大的提升空间，需要未来的进一步研究

Abstract: AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models
(LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing
subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression
tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc
problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much
deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training
data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR
tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis
that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient
descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and
lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with
neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both
baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

TL;DR: PiCSAR是一种无需训练的评分方法，通过联合对数似然评估推理链和最终答案，在数学推理任务上显著优于现有方法，使用更少样本获得更好效果


<details>

Motivation: 解决推理任务中缺乏真实答案时如何设计评分函数来识别正确推理链的关键挑战

Method: 提出概率置信选择与排序(PiCSAR)，使用推理过程和最终答案的联合对数似然来评分候选生成，该方法自然分解为推理置信度和答案置信度

Result: 在多个基准测试上取得显著提升(MATH500 +10.18, AIME2025 +9.81)，在20次比较中有16次使用至少少2倍的样本就超越了基线方法

Conclusion: 正确推理链展现出显著更高的推理和答案置信度，验证了PiCSAR方法的有效性

Abstract: Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and
large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and
selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning
tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning
chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic
Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that
scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the
reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final
answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.
PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,
+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in
16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains
exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the
effectiveness of PiCSAR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型架构中的归纳偏置如何影响其在教学对话中的认知行为，探索通过架构设计来塑造模型的教学策略。

Method: 使用符号支架机制和短期记忆模式，通过五个系统变体的受控消融实验，使用专家设计的评分标准评估模型输出，并采用基于LLM的评估框架进行可扩展的系统比较。

Result: 完整系统在所有基线变体中表现最佳，移除记忆或符号结构会降低关键认知行为（如抽象、自适应探测和概念连续性）。

Conclusion: 架构支架能够可靠地塑造大语言模型中涌现的教学策略，支持处理层面的解释，表明架构设计对模型认知行为具有重要影响。

Abstract: We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior
of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a
symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed
to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using
controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via
expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic
reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an
LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This
enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in
early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system
consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing
memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including
abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings
support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can
reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

Abstract: In the past two years, large language model (LLM)-based chatbots, such as
ChatGPT, have revolutionized various domains by enabling diverse task
completion and question-answering capabilities. However, their application in
scientific research remains constrained by challenges such as hallucinations,
limited domain-specific knowledge, and lack of explainability or traceability
for the response. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has
emerged as a promising approach to improving chatbot reliability by integrating
domain-specific contextual information before response generation, addressing
some limitations of standard LLMs. Despite its potential, there are only
limited studies that evaluate GraphRAG on specific domains that require
intensive knowledge, like Alzheimer's disease or other biomedical domains. In
this paper, we assess the quality and traceability of two popular GraphRAG
systems. We compile a database of 50 papers and 70 expert questions related to
Alzheimer's disease, construct a GraphRAG knowledge base, and employ GPT-4o as
the LLM for answering queries. We then compare the quality of responses
generated by GraphRAG with those from a standard GPT-4o model. Additionally, we
discuss and evaluate the traceability of several Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and GraphRAG systems. Finally, we provide an easy-to-use interface with a
pre-built Alzheimer's disease database for researchers to test the performance
of both standard RAG and GraphRAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单一本体系统或孤立的多本体系统，缺乏跨本体连接的整合学习结构，导致概念表示学习局限于本体内部关系。

Method: 1) 使用LLM进行图检索增强的初始化，包含概念描述和本体上下文；2) 在双轴进行知识传播：本体内部垂直传播和跨本体水平传播；3) 作为插件编码器与现有EHR预测模型兼容。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的实验验证了LINKO优于最先进基线方法，在数据有限和罕见疾病预测场景中表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LINKO框架通过整合多本体系统的双轴知识传播，显著提升了医学概念表示学习的效果，特别是在数据稀缺和罕见病例预测方面表现出色。

Abstract: Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic
health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved
connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical
concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related
concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating
domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology
systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without
integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept
representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,
overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a
large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework
that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis
knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to
enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first
employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology
concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept
descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our
method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by
performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical
propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology
horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive
experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of
LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with
existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness
in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.

<details>

Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理任务上表现出色，但在简单交互任务中表现不佳，这揭示了陈述性知识和程序性知识之间的关键差距

Method: TiG框架将基于强化学习的决策重新表述为语言建模任务：LLM生成语言引导的策略，通过基于环境反馈的在线强化学习进行迭代优化

Result: TiG成功弥合了陈述性知识和程序性知识之间的差距，以显著更低的数据和计算需求实现了与传统强化学习方法相竞争的性能

Conclusion: TiG不仅提高了在复杂交互任务中的性能，还通过提供逐步的自然语言解释，大大提高了透明度和可解释性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding, yet they frequently struggle with simple interactive
tasks that young children perform effortlessly. This discrepancy highlights a
critical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and
procedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through
environmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require
substantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge
and reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static
knowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this
challenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers
LLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game
environments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory
abilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a
language modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are
refined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on
environmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully
bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving
competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands
compared to conventional RL methods. Moreover, TiG provides step-by-step
natural language explanations for its decisions, greatly improving transparency
and interpretability in complex interactive tasks.

TL;DR: AHELM是一个全面的音频-语言模型基准测试，集成了10个评估维度，包括感知、知识、推理、情感检测、偏见、公平性、多语言性、鲁棒性、毒性和安全性，并提供了标准化的提示和评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前音频-语言模型评估缺乏标准化基准，大多数基准只测试一两个能力，且忽略了公平性、安全性等重要方面，不同评估之间难以进行公平比较。

Method: 开发AHELM基准，整合多个数据集（包括两个新的合成音频-文本数据集PARADE和CoRe-Bench），标准化提示、推理参数和评估指标，测试了14个开放权重和闭源API模型以及3个基线系统。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro在10个方面中的5个排名第一，但在ASR任务中表现出群体不公平性（p=0.01），基线系统表现良好，其中一个仅具有语音转文本功能的系统总体排名第五。

Conclusion: AHELM提供了一个全面的音频-语言模型评估框架，揭示了当前模型的优势和不足，特别是公平性问题，基准将持续更新以促进该领域的发展。

Abstract: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take
interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack
of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two
capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety.
Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test
a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference
parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that
aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets
called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and
CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through
inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the
performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the
development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion
detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.
We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics
to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and
closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each
consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results
show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits
group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do
not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM,
with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities.
For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available
on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0. AHELM is
intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added
over time.

Abstract: Forgetting as a knowledge management operation deliberately ignores parts of
the knowledge and beliefs of an agent, for various reasons. Forgetting has many
facets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a
conditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing
forgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable
elimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to
focus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic
programming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief
revision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical
deduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we
take an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic
states with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional
logic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic
background means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to
the epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and
instantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking
functions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic
programming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating
forgetting operations. Finally, we evaluate all concrete forgetting operations
according to all postulates, leading to a novel comprehensive overview
highlighting differences and commonalities among the forgetting operators.

Conclusion: 提出的STRIPS+框架和SYNTH算法能够有效处理部分可观测状态和动作参数缺失的模型学习问题，为更现实的场景提供了解决方案

Abstract: Consider the problem of learning a lifted STRIPS model of the sliding-tile
puzzle from random state-action traces where the states represent the location
of the tiles only, and the actions are the labels up, down, left, and right,
with no arguments. Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the
states are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the
atoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not
full STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the
actions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different
versions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the
traces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all
observable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as
the atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,
and the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not
the ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the
learning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,
where certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions
which can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The
learning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+
state-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH,
constructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or
``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground
the implicit action arguments in STRIPS+. The correctness and completeness of
SYNTH is established, and its scalability is tested on state-action traces
obtained from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.

Motivation: 现有的多模态浏览基准测试往往可以通过浅层的固定工作流程解决，无法真正测试模型在细粒度视觉推理、来源验证和长时程工具使用方面的多模态能力。

Abstract: Large multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed as web
agents, yet many multimodal browsing benchmarks can be solved by shallow, fixed
workflows that lean on high-recall image search and nearby text-masking the
genuinely multimodal challenges of fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance
verification, and long-horizon tool use. We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a
benchmark of 311 tasks that highly demand multimodal understanding while
preserving the difficulty profile of strong text-only browsing suites. Each
item is constructed to contain multiple weak, localized visual signals that
must be extracted, propagated through iterative text-image search, and
cross-validated under retrieval noise before answering. Our curation procedure,
Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation, seeds questions whose answers require
extrapolating from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts,
signage) and temporal traces (broadcast overlays, seasonal context) to
out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. We provide a
model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and evaluate a range of
closed and open MLLMs. The strongest agent (o3) attains 15.1% without search
and 36.0% accuracy with rollout under our framework, while a strong open-source
model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) achieves 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20
rounds of search. Beyond answer accuracy, we assess bounding-box production and
cropped-image search, and conduct an error analysis that surfaces failures in
source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

Result: 系统产生的双属性智慧表征与现有量表有显著但适度的相关性，与无关特质关系可忽略，支持了聚合效度和区分效度。

Conclusion: 该研究将智慧形式化为多维且考虑不确定性的构念，为心理学测量进步提供了新方法，同时为AI系统提供了可解释的、置信度敏感的推理框架。

Abstract: Background: Wisdom is a superordinate construct that embraces perspective
taking, reflectiveness, prosocial orientation, reflective empathetic action,
and intellectual humility. Unlike conventional models of reasoning that are
rigidly bound by binary thinking, wisdom unfolds in shades of ambiguity,
requiring both graded evaluation and self-reflective humility. Current measures
depend on self-reports and seldom reflect the humility and uncertainty inherent
in wise reasoning. A computational framework that takes into account both
multidimensionality and confidence has the potential to improve psychological
science and allow humane AI. Method: We present a fuzzy inference system with Z
numbers, each of the decisions being expressed in terms of a wisdom score
(restriction) and confidence score (certainty). As part of this study,
participants (N = 100) were exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral
dilemma tasks to which they generated think-aloud linguistic responses, which
were mapped into five theoretically based components of wisdom. The scores of
each individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with
membership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In
a proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom
representations that correlated modestly but significantly with established
scales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting
convergent and divergent validity. Contribution: The contribution is to
formalize wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct,
operationalized in the form of Z-numbers. In addition to progressing
measurement in psychology, it calculates how fuzzy Z numbers can provide AI
systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that affords a safe,
middle ground between rigorous computation and human-like judgment.

*Nicola Gigante,Francesco Leofante,Andrea Micheli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于反事实场景的新型解释范式，用于自动规划领域，通过最小化修改规划问题来生成满足特定属性要求的计划解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的反事实解释方法在自动规划中主要关注对现有计划的微小修改，但无法捕捉问题的高层特性，需要一种能够解释规划问题本身特性的新方法。

Method: 提出了基于反事实场景的解释范式，给定规划问题P和LTLf公式ψ，识别对P的最小修改使得其能够产生符合ψ的计划。提出了两种基于计划量化的定性实例化方法，并分析了不同类型修改的计算复杂度。

Result: 研究表明生成反事实场景的计算复杂度通常与计算P的计划相当，证明了该方法的实际可行性，为构建实用算法提供了框架。

Conclusion: 反事实场景解释范式能够有效捕捉规划问题的高层特性，计算复杂度可控，为自动规划领域的解释性研究提供了实用的理论基础和算法框架。

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) are a powerful technique used to explain
Machine Learning models by showing how the input to a model should be minimally
changed for the model to produce a different output. Similar proposals have
been made in the context of Automated Planning, where CEs have been
characterised in terms of minimal modifications to an existing plan that would
result in the satisfaction of a different goal. While such explanations may
help diagnose faults and reason about the characteristics of a plan, they fail
to capture higher-level properties of the problem being solved. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel explanation paradigm that is based on
counterfactual scenarios. In particular, given a planning problem $P$ and an
\ltlf formula $\psi$ defining desired properties of a plan, counterfactual
scenarios identify minimal modifications to $P$ such that it admits plans that
comply with $\psi$. In this paper, we present two qualitative instantiations of
counterfactual scenarios based on an explicit quantification over plans that
must satisfy $\psi$. We then characterise the computational complexity of
generating such counterfactual scenarios when different types of changes are
allowed on $P$. We show that producing counterfactual scenarios is often only
as expensive as computing a plan for $P$, thus demonstrating the practical
viability of our proposal and ultimately providing a framework to construct
practical algorithms in this area.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HealthProcessAI是一个基于GenAI的框架，通过整合多个大型语言模型(LLM)来自动解释过程挖掘结果并生成报告，简化了医疗保健领域过程挖掘的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过程挖掘在医疗保健工作流分析中面临技术复杂性、缺乏标准化方法和实践培训资源有限等障碍，需要开发更易用的工具来提升可访问性。

Method: 开发了一个综合框架，包装现有的Python(PM4PY)和R(bupaR)库，集成多个LLM进行自动化过程图解释和报告生成，使用脓毒症进展数据作为概念验证。

Result: 框架成功处理了四个概念验证场景的脓毒症数据，技术性能稳健。LLM评估显示Claude Sonnet-4和Gemini 2.5-Pro获得最高一致性分数(3.79/4.0和3.65/4.0)。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合结构化分析和AI驱动的解释，为将复杂的过程挖掘结果转化为医疗保健应用的可操作洞察提供了新颖的方法学进展。

Abstract: Process mining has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for
understanding complex healthcare workflows. However, its application faces
significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized
approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce
HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining
applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive
wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address
unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple
Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and
report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that
diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis
progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five
state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its
functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four
proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its
capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation
using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model
strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency
scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By
integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation
and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with
process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data
scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven
interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in
translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights
for healthcare applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的跨域通用地标发现框架，通过学习已解决实例自动生成通用地标，用于规划问题的中间目标设定，显著提升启发式性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统地标提取算法在处理具有重复性子计划的规划问题时存在局限，需要一种能够自动发现并推广到整个域的通用地标方法

Method: 使用状态函数构建独立于具体对象的通用地标，建立有向通用地标图来描述地标进展，包括重复性子计划的循环可能性，并将其用于启发式求解新问题

Result: 实验表明，从少量小实例学习的通用地标图对同一域中较大实例同样有效，当识别到重复循环时，启发式性能相比基线有显著提升

Conclusion: 通用地标能够捕获可解释的域信息，对自动化规划器非常有用，这些信息可以从同一域的少量计划中发现

Abstract: We propose a new framework for discovering landmarks that automatically
generalize across a domain. These generalized landmarks are learned from a set
of solved instances and describe intermediate goals for planning problems where
traditional landmark extraction algorithms fall short. Our generalized
landmarks extend beyond the predicates of a domain by using state functions
that are independent of the objects of a specific problem and apply to all
similar objects, thus capturing repetition. Based on these functions, we
construct a directed generalized landmark graph that defines the landmark
progression, including loop possibilities for repetitive subplans. We show how
to use this graph in a heuristic to solve new problem instances of the same
domain. Our results show that the generalized landmark graphs learned from a
few small instances are also effective for larger instances in the same domain.
If a loop that indicates repetition is identified, we see a significant
improvement in heuristic performance over the baseline. Generalized landmarks
capture domain information that is interpretable and useful to an automated
planner. This information can be discovered from a small set of plans for the
same domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多高层次多智能体规划问题（如多机器人导航）可以用确定性动作和观察有效建模，但现有Dec-POMDP求解器无法高效处理大规模问题

Method: 基于经典联合均衡搜索策略框架，提出了迭代确定性POMDP规划（IDPP）方法，专门优化处理大规模Det-Dec-POMDPs

Result: IDPP方法能够处理当前Dec-POMDP求解器无法高效解决的大规模确定性分散POMDP问题

Conclusion: Det-Dec-POMDPs为多智能体规划提供了有效的建模框架，IDPP方法为此类大规模问题提供了实用的求解方案

Abstract: Many high-level multi-agent planning problems, including multi-robot
navigation and path planning, can be effectively modeled using deterministic
actions and observations.
  In this work, we focus on such domains and introduce the class of
Deterministic Decentralized POMDPs (Det-Dec-POMDPs). This is a subclass of
Dec-POMDPs characterized by deterministic transitions and observations
conditioned on the state and joint actions.
  We then propose a practical solver called Iterative Deterministic POMDP
Planning (IDPP). This method builds on the classic Joint Equilibrium Search for
Policies framework and is specifically optimized to handle large-scale
Det-Dec-POMDPs that current Dec-POMDP solvers are unable to address
efficiently.

Conclusion: 未来将整合私有LLM、迁移学习、强化学习和贝叶斯神经网络，以增强可解释性、适应性和实时决策能力

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated framework that combines traditional network
optimization models with large language models (LLMs) to deliver interactive,
explainable, and role-aware decision support for supply chain planning. The
proposed system bridges the gap between complex operations research outputs and
business stakeholder understanding by generating natural language summaries,
contextual visualizations, and tailored key performance indicators (KPIs). The
core optimization model addresses tactical inventory redistribution across a
network of distribution centers for multi-period and multi-item, using a
mixed-integer formulation. The technical architecture incorporates AI agents,
RESTful APIs, and a dynamic user interface to support real-time interaction,
configuration updates, and simulation-based insights. A case study demonstrates
how the system improves planning outcomes by preventing stockouts, reducing
costs, and maintaining service levels. Future extensions include integrating
private LLMs, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian neural
networks to enhance explainability, adaptability, and real-time
decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MHA*虽然利用多个不可采纳启发式函数来加速搜索，但它是单次算法，无法随时间持续改进解的质量，需要仔细设置膨胀因子。

Method: 受随时修复A*（ARA*）启发，将ARA*的概念精确适配到MHA*框架中，开发了随时多启发式A*（A-MHA*）算法。

Result: A-MHA*在3D路径规划和滑块拼图领域表现出色，相比MHA*和其他随时算法具有更好的性能。

Conclusion: A-MHA*成功将MHA*扩展为随时算法，保持了原有的次优性和完备性保证，能够在有限时间内持续改进解的质量。

Abstract: Designing good heuristic functions for graph search requires adequate domain
knowledge. It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and
correlate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the
search space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby
affecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search
using several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in
Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible
heuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original
version does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm
that requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time
solution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime
version that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually
improves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime
Repairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA*
concepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and
completeness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion.
Furthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain
and sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms.

TL;DR: MEDLEY框架将AI偏见重新定义为有价值的多样性资源，通过整合多个AI模型的多样化输出来增强医疗诊断，而不是消除偏见达成共识


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统医学AI将偏见视为需要消除的缺陷，但人类推理本身就包含偏见，这些偏见可能具有价值。研究者希望探索如何利用AI模型的多样性来增强医疗诊断

Method: 提出MEDLEY概念框架，协调多个AI模型同时保留其多样化输出，将模型特定偏见视为潜在优势，将幻觉视为需要临床验证的临时假设。开发了包含30多个大语言模型的概念验证演示器

Result: 概念验证演示器在合成病例中成功保留了共识和少数观点，使诊断不确定性和潜在偏见对临床监督透明可见

Conclusion: MEDLEY通过将AI不完美性重新定义为资源，为开发可信赖的医疗AI系统提供了新的监管、伦理和创新途径，展示了结构化多样性如何在临床监督下增强医疗推理

Abstract: Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect
requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases
shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be
inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble
Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that
orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather
than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that
suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential
strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician
verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large
language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both
consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty
and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated
clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can
enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI
imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new
regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical
AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了科学文档的层次结构和文本视觉元素的语义整合，需要同时解决这两个挑战

Method: 提出Poster Tree层次化中间表示，采用多智能体协作策略（内容摘要和布局规划智能体），通过迭代协调和相互反馈实现联合优化

Result: 在多个学术领域的实验中，方法在定性和定量评估上均优于现有基线，生成的海报质量最接近专家设计，具有更好的信息保留、结构清晰度和用户偏好

Conclusion: PosterForest框架通过创新的层次化表示和多智能体协作，有效解决了科学海报生成中的结构化和多模态整合问题，取得了优异的性能

Abstract: We present a novel training-free framework, \textit{PosterForest}, for
automated scientific poster generation. Unlike prior approaches, which largely
neglect the hierarchical structure of scientific documents and the semantic
integration of textual and visual elements, our method addresses both
challenges directly. We introduce the \textit{Poster Tree}, a hierarchical
intermediate representation that jointly encodes document structure and
visual-textual relationships at multiple levels. Our framework employs a
multi-agent collaboration strategy, where agents specializing in content
summarization and layout planning iteratively coordinate and provide mutual
feedback. This approach enables the joint optimization of logical consistency,
content fidelity, and visual coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple
academic domains show that our method outperforms existing baselines in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The resulting posters achieve quality
closest to expert-designed ground truth and deliver superior information
preservation, structural clarity, and user preference.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于旅行商问题的变分算法，结合紧凑排列编码和优化-冻结-重用策略，在NISQ硬件上实现快速求解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决旅行商问题在量子计算中的实现难题，通过减少量子比特需求和避免测试时的结构搜索来适应NISQ硬件限制。

Method: 使用紧凑排列编码减少量子比特需求，采用优化-冻结-重用策略：先通过模拟退火优化训练实例的电路拓扑，然后冻结结构并重用于新实例，仅重新优化电路参数。

Result: 在4-7个城市的40个随机对称实例上，4城市达到100%最优路径采样概率，5城市90%，6城市80%，7城市降至约20%，显示出良好的中等规模问题泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法对中等规模问题具有鲁棒的泛化能力，冻结Ansatz能显著减少求解时间而不降低解质量，但存在可扩展性限制，有望扩展到车辆路径和作业车间调度等更复杂问题。

Abstract: In this paper we present a variational algorithm for the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP) that combines (i) a compact encoding of permutations, which
reduces the qubit requirement too, (ii) an optimize-freeze-reuse strategy:
where the circuit topology (``Ansatz'') is first optimized on a training
instance by Simulated Annealing (SA), then ``frozen'' and re-used on novel
instances, limited to a rapid re-optimization of only the circuit parameters.
This pipeline eliminates costly structural research in testing, making the
procedure immediately implementable on NISQ hardware.
  On a set of $40$ randomly generated symmetric instances that span $4 - 7$
cities, the resulting Ansatz achieves an average optimal trip sampling
probability of $100\%$ for 4 city cases, $90\%$ for 5 city cases and $80\%$ for
6 city cases. With 7 cities the success rate drops markedly to an average of
$\sim 20\%$, revealing the onset of scalability limitations of the proposed
method.
  The results show robust generalization ability for moderate problem sizes and
indicate how freezing the Ansatz can dramatically reduce time-to-solution
without degrading solution quality. The paper also discusses scalability
limitations, the impact of ``warm-start'' initialization of parameters, and
prospects for extension to more complex problems, such as Vehicle Routing and
Job-Shop Scheduling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分析中理解时间变量间的因果关系是一个核心挑战，特别是在完整因果结构未知的情况下。专家通常能提供高层摘要因果图，但如何利用这种知识来指导微观层面的因果发现需要理论支持。

Method: 提出了在给定摘要因果图和假设存在忠实且因果充分的分布条件下，保证微观层面边可定向性的理论条件。这些条件即使在宏观层面存在循环或双向边的情况下也适用。

Result: 建立了微观层面边定向的理论保证，证明了在特定条件下可以利用摘要因果图来指导时间序列数据的因果发现。

Conclusion: 研究结果为利用专家知识改进从观测时间序列数据中进行因果推断提供了实用指导，强调了结合专家知识在复杂时间系统因果发现中的价值。

Abstract: Understanding causal relations between temporal variables is a central
challenge in time series analysis, particularly when the full causal structure
is unknown. Even when the full causal structure cannot be fully specified,
experts often succeed in providing a high-level abstraction of the causal
graph, known as a summary causal graph, which captures the main causal
relations between different time series while abstracting away micro-level
details. In this work, we present conditions that guarantee the orientability
of micro-level edges between temporal variables given the background knowledge
encoded in a summary causal graph and assuming having access to a faithful and
causally sufficient distribution with respect to the true unknown graph. Our
results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level,
even in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level. These
findings offer practical guidance for leveraging SCGs to inform causal
discovery in complex temporal systems and highlight the value of incorporating
expert knowledge to improve causal inference from observational time series
data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Tree-guided Diffusion Planner (TDP)，一种零样本测试时规划框架，通过结构化轨迹生成平衡探索与利用，在非凸目标、不可微分约束和多奖励场景中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的规划方法在凸可微分奖励场景表现良好，但在现实世界的非凸目标、不可微分约束和多奖励结构中效果显著下降。监督规划方法需要任务特定训练或价值估计器，限制了测试时灵活性和零样本泛化能力。

Method: 将测试时规划构建为树搜索问题，采用双层采样过程：1) 通过无训练粒子引导生成多样化父轨迹以鼓励广泛探索；2) 通过任务目标引导的快速条件去噪精炼子轨迹。仅使用预训练模型和测试时奖励信号。

Result: 在三个多样化任务上评估：迷宫金币收集、机器人手臂积木操作和AntMaze多目标探索。TDP在所有任务上始终优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: TDP通过探索多样化轨迹区域并利用扩展解空间中的梯度信息，成功解决了梯度引导的局限性，为测试时规划提供了有效的零样本解决方案。

Abstract: Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach
for solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient
guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward
landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios
involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and
multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches
require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time
flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion
Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances
exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame
test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:
(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle
guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined
through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the
limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and
harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only
pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three
diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze
multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on all tasks. The project page can be found at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种多智能体协作系统来模拟临床团队会诊，通过动态分配专家智能体进行分层迭代辩论，在识别充血性心力衰竭、急性肾损伤和败血症等临床问题方面表现优于单智能体基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床叙述的准确解读对患者护理至关重要，但单一大语言模型方法在高风险临床任务中缺乏足够的鲁棒性，需要更可靠的自动化解决方案。

Method: 设计了一个协作多智能体系统，模拟临床会诊团队。Manager智能体协调动态分配的专家智能体团队，通过分层迭代辩论达成共识，仅使用SOAP笔记中的主观(S)和客观(O)部分进行临床问题识别。

Result: 在420份MIMIC-III笔记数据集上的评估显示，动态多智能体配置在识别充血性心力衰竭、急性肾损伤和败血症方面持续表现出改进的性能。定性分析表明该结构能有效呈现和权衡冲突证据。

Conclusion: 通过模拟临床团队的推理过程，该系统为开发更准确、鲁棒和可解释的临床决策支持工具提供了有前景的路径，尽管偶尔可能受到群体思维的影响。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care,
but the complexity of these notes makes automation challenging. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the
robustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a
collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team
to address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by
analyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes,
simulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an
assessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of
specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a
consensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated
dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration
demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart
failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent
debates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting
evidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling
a clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward
more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.

TL;DR: 研究发现RecBole推荐框架的默认设置（特别是未文档化的早停策略）会过早终止随机搜索和贝叶斯优化，限制搜索范围，导致性能差异与搜索策略间的差异相当，呼吁提高超参数调优的透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超参数优化对推荐系统性能至关重要，但现有研究往往将其视为次要问题。本文旨在审计广泛使用的RecBole推荐框架的行为，揭示其内部默认设置对超参数搜索的影响。

Method: 使用六个模型和两个数据集，比较不同搜索策略，量化性能方差和搜索路径不稳定性，重点分析RecBole框架的未文档化早停策略对随机搜索和贝叶斯优化的影响。

Result: 发现RecBole的隐藏框架逻辑会过早终止超参数搜索，限制搜索覆盖范围，引入的变异性与不同搜索策略之间的差异相当，这些影响对用户不可见。

Conclusion: 推荐框架应被视为实验设计的主动组成部分，需要更透明、可复现的工具。研究为开发者和研究人员提供了可操作建议，以减轻隐藏配置行为的影响并提高超参数调优工作流程的透明度。

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization is critical for improving the performance of
recommender systems, yet its implementation is often treated as a neutral or
secondary concern. In this work, we shift focus from model benchmarking to
auditing the behavior of RecBole, a widely used recommendation framework. We
show that RecBole's internal defaults, particularly an undocumented
early-stopping policy, can prematurely terminate Random Search and Bayesian
Optimization. This limits search coverage in ways that are not visible to
users. Using six models and two datasets, we compare search strategies and
quantify both performance variance and search path instability. Our findings
reveal that hidden framework logic can introduce variability comparable to the
differences between search strategies. These results highlight the importance
of treating frameworks as active components of experimental design and call for
more transparent, reproducibility-aware tooling in recommender systems
research. We provide actionable recommendations for researchers and developers
to mitigate hidden configuration behaviors and improve the transparency of
hyperparameter tuning workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统对交互历史有限的新用户（冷启动用户）推荐效果不佳，且需要依赖敏感的人口统计数据，存在隐私问题

Method: 结合双DQN和决斗DQN的强化学习框架，与矩阵分解模型集成，从稀疏反馈中动态学习用户偏好

Result: 在大型电商数据集上表现优于基于流行度和主动学习等传统方法，特别是决斗DQN显著降低了冷启动用户的RMSE

Conclusion: 该方法为隐私受限环境提供了有效的冷启动用户推荐解决方案，无需依赖敏感数据即可提升推荐准确性

Abstract: Recommender systems struggle to provide accurate suggestions to new users
with limited interaction history, a challenge known as the cold-user problem.
This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach using Double and Dueling
Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to dynamically learn user preferences from sparse
feedback, enhancing recommendation accuracy without relying on sensitive
demographic data. By integrating these advanced DQN variants with a matrix
factorization model, we achieve superior performance on a large e-commerce
dataset compared to traditional methods like popularity-based and active
learning strategies. Experimental results show that our method, particularly
Dueling DQN, reduces Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for cold users, offering an
effective solution for privacy-constrained environments.

TL;DR: CDCDA-PLM是一个在用户设备上部署个性化语言模型的框架，通过云端LLM增强有限个人数据，使用参数高效微调技术实现本地个性化模型，解决了响应延迟和网络依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型存在两个主要问题：响应缺乏个性化定制，以及严重依赖云端基础设施导致网络依赖和响应延迟。需要同时解决个性化和本地部署的问题。

Method: 提出CDCDA-PLM框架，利用云端LLM的强大泛化能力增强用户有限的个人数据，使用真实和合成数据，通过参数高效微调(PEFT)模块在本地设备上微调个性化语言模型。

Result: 在广泛使用的个性化基准测试的六个任务中，实验结果表明CDCDA-PLM的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了在用户设备上部署个性化语言模型，消除了对网络稳定性的依赖，确保了高响应速度，同时解决了数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), significant progress
has been achieved in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However,
existing LLMs still face two major challenges that hinder their broader
adoption: (1) their responses tend to be generic and lack personalization
tailored to individual users, and (2) they rely heavily on cloud infrastructure
due to intensive computational requirements, leading to stable network
dependency and response delay. Recent research has predominantly focused on
either developing cloud-based personalized LLMs or exploring the on-device
deployment of general-purpose LLMs. However, few studies have addressed both
limitations simultaneously by investigating personalized on-device language
models. To bridge this gap, we propose CDCDA-PLM, a framework for deploying
personalized on-device language models on user devices with support from a
powerful cloud-based LLM. Specifically, CDCDA-PLM leverages the server-side
LLM's strong generalization capabilities to augment users' limited personal
data, mitigating the issue of data scarcity. Using both real and synthetic
data, A personalized on-device language models (LMs) is fine-tuned via
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules and deployed on users' local
devices, enabling them to process queries without depending on cloud-based
LLMs. This approach eliminates reliance on network stability and ensures high
response speeds. Experimental results across six tasks in a widely used
personalization benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of CDCDA-PLM.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 该研究填补了推荐系统中群体公平性和个体公平性关系理解的空白，通过综合比较两种公平性的评估指标，发现高度群体公平的推荐可能对个体非常不公平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统中的公平性通常分为群体公平和个体公平，但两者之间的关系缺乏科学理解，因为先前研究使用不同的评估指标或目标，无法进行恰当比较。目前不清楚提高一种公平性如何影响另一种公平性。

Method: 通过全面比较可用于两种公平性类型的评估指标，研究群体公平性和个体公平性之间的关系。在3个数据集上进行了8次运行的实验。

Result: 实验表明，对群体高度公平的推荐可能对个体非常不公平。

Conclusion: 这一发现对旨在提高系统公平性的推荐系统从业者具有新颖性和实用性。

Abstract: Fairness in recommender systems (RSs) is commonly categorised into group
fairness and individual fairness. However, there is no established scientific
understanding of the relationship between the two fairness types, as prior work
on both types has used different evaluation measures or evaluation objectives
for each fairness type, thereby not allowing for a proper comparison of the
two. As a result, it is currently not known how increasing one type of fairness
may affect the other. To fill this gap, we study the relationship of group and
individual fairness through a comprehensive comparison of evaluation measures
that can be used for both fairness types. Our experiments with 8 runs across 3
datasets show that recommendations that are highly fair for groups can be very
unfair for individuals. Our finding is novel and useful for RS practitioners
aiming to improve the fairness of their systems. Our code is available at:

foundation models across diverse datasets and domains is essential for
advancing the development of recommendation foundation models. In this study,
we introduce RecBench-MD, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to
assess the recommendation abilities of foundation models from a zero-resource,
multi-dataset, and multi-domain perspective. Through extensive evaluations of
19 foundation models across 15 datasets spanning 10 diverse domains --

characteristics of these models in recommendation tasks. Our findings suggest
that in-domain fine-tuning achieves optimal performance, while cross-dataset
transfer learning provides effective practical support for new recommendation
scenarios. Additionally, we observe that multi-domain training significantly
enhances the adaptability of foundation models. All code and data have been
publicly released to facilitate future research.

### [123] [Diffusion-based Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network for Click-through Rate Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21460)
*Xiaoxi Cui,Weihai Lu,Yu Tong,Yiheng Li,Zhejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出Diff-MSIN框架，通过多模态特征增强、协同关系捕获和特征动态自适应融合三个模块，解决了现有多模态CTR预测方法无法有效解耦模态共性与特性以及忽略模态间协同效应的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTR预测方法主要基于ID模态，无法全面建模用户的多模态偏好。虽然可以直接应用现有多模态融合方法，但这些方法无法有效解耦不同模态的共性与特性，也未考虑模态间的协同效应和复杂交互。

Method: 提出Diff-MSIN框架，包含三个创新模块：多模态特征增强(MFE)模块、协同关系捕获(SRC)模块和特征动态自适应融合(FDAF)模块。MFE和SRC模块提取模态间的协同、共性和特殊信息，FDAF模块捕获用户偏好并减少融合噪声。还设计了知识解耦方法以增强特征区分性。

Result: 在Rec-Tmall和三个Amazon数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比基线至少提升1.67%，显著改善了多模态推荐系统的性能。

Conclusion: Diff-MSIN框架有效解决了多模态CTR预测中的模态解耦和协同效应建模问题，为多模态推荐系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In click-through rate prediction, click-through rate prediction is used to
model users' interests. However, most of the existing CTR prediction methods
are mainly based on the ID modality. As a result, they are unable to
comprehensively model users' multi-modal preferences. Therefore, it is
necessary to introduce multi-modal CTR prediction. Although it seems appealing
to directly apply the existing multi-modal fusion methods to click-through rate
prediction models, these methods (1) fail to effectively disentangle
commonalities and specificities across different modalities; (2) fail to
consider the synergistic effects between modalities and model the complex
interactions between modalities.
  To address the above issues, this paper proposes the Diffusion-based
Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network (Diff-MSIN) framework for click-through
prediction. This framework introduces three innovative modules: the Multi-modal
Feature Enhancement (MFE) Module Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC) Module,
and the Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF) Module. The MFE Module and SRC
Module extract synergistic, common, and special information among different
modalities. They effectively enhances the representation of the modalities,
improving the overall quality of the fusion. To encourage distinctiveness among
different features, we design a Knowledge Decoupling method. Additionally, the
FDAF Module focuses on capturing user preferences and reducing fusion noise. To
validate the effectiveness of the Diff-MSIN framework, we conducted extensive
experiments using the Rec-Tmall and three Amazon datasets. The results
demonstrate that our approach yields a significant improvement of at least
1.67% compared to the baseline, highlighting its potential for enhancing
multi-modal recommendation systems. Our code is available at the following

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于历史地图的GeoQA系统，结合时空知识图谱和大型语言模型，支持事实性和描述性地理问答，具有高准确率和交互式可视化界面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了充分利用数字历史地图中提取的矢量化特征，需要以结构化方式组织这些信息，支持用户通过自然语言问答方式获取知识，特别是为不熟悉数据库查询语言的用户提供便利。

Method: 构建时空知识图谱并定义本体，集成大型语言模型，开发两种GeoQA工作流（事实性和描述性），整合历史地图图像和网络搜索结果作为额外上下文。

Result: 系统能够以高交付率和高语义准确性生成答案，开发了支持交互式查询和可视化的Web应用程序。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了基于历史地图的地理问答系统，为历史地理信息的自然语言访问提供了有效解决方案，具有很好的实用性和可访问性。

Abstract: Recent advances have enabled the extraction of vectorized features from
digital historical maps. To fully leverage this information, however, the
extracted features must be organized in a structured and meaningful way that
supports efficient access and use. One promising approach is question answering
(QA), which allows users -- especially those unfamiliar with database query
languages -- to retrieve knowledge in a natural and intuitive manner. In this
project, we developed a GeoQA system by integrating a spatio-temporal knowledge
graph (KG) constructed from historical map data with large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, we have defined the ontology to guide the construction of
the spatio-temporal KG and investigated workflows of two different types of
GeoQA: factual and descriptive. Additional data sources, such as historical map
images and internet search results, are incorporated into our framework to
provide extra context for descriptive GeoQA. Evaluation results demonstrate
that the system can generate answers with a high delivery rate and a high
semantic accuracy. To make the framework accessible, we further developed a web
application that supports interactive querying and visualization.

increasingly difficult. This is due to a fragmented ecosystem of diverse
codebases, varied configurations, and mainly due to resource-intensive models.
We introduce NewsReX, an open-source library designed to streamline this
process. Our key contribution is a modern implementation built on Keras 3 and
JAX, which provides an increase in computational efficiency. Experiments show
that NewsReX is faster than current implementations. To support broader
research, we provide a straightforward guide and scripts for training models on
custom datasets. We validated this functionality using a proprietary Japanese
news dataset from Nikkei News, a leading Japanese media corporation renowned
for its comprehensive coverage of business, economic, and financial news.
NewsReX makes reproducing complex experiments faster and more accessible to a
wider range of hardware making sure the speed up it also achieved for less
powerful GPUs, like an 8GB RTX 3060 Ti. Beyond the library, this paper offers
an analysis of key training parameters often overlooked in the literature,
including the effect of different negative sampling strategies, the varying
number of epochs, the impact of random batching, and more. This supplementary

Method: 理论分析双塔模型的可识别性条件，研究日志策略对模型的影响，提出样本加权技术来减轻偏差。

Result: 发现文档位置交换或特征分布重叠是恢复模型参数的必要条件，日志策略在模型完美捕捉用户行为时不引入偏差，但在模型不完美时会放大偏差。

Conclusion: 双塔模型训练需要关注可识别性条件和日志策略的影响，样本加权技术能有效缓解偏差，为研究者和从业者提供实用建议。

Abstract: Additive two-tower models are popular learning-to-rank methods for handling
biased user feedback in industry settings. Recent studies, however, report a
concerning phenomenon: training two-tower models on clicks collected by
well-performing production systems leads to decreased ranking performance. This
paper investigates two recent explanations for this observation: confounding
effects from logging policies and model identifiability issues. We
theoretically analyze the identifiability conditions of two-tower models,
showing that either document swaps across positions or overlapping feature
distributions are required to recover model parameters from clicks. We also
investigate the effect of logging policies on two-tower models, finding that
they introduce no bias when models perfectly capture user behavior. However,
logging policies can amplify biases when models imperfectly capture user
behavior, particularly when prediction errors correlate with document placement
across positions. We propose a sample weighting technique to mitigate these
effects and provide actionable insights for researchers and practitioners using
two-tower models.

*Xuejun Chang,Zaiqiao Meng,Debasis Ganguly*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于主题的局部可检索性度量方法(T-Retrievability)，用于更准确地评估检索模型的曝光偏差，而不是简单地使用全局可检索性分数分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的可检索性分数在整个集合上的不均匀分布可能不能准确反映曝光偏差，而是反映了主题相关性的变化。需要一种更细粒度的度量方法来评估检索系统的曝光公平性。

Method: 首先计算多个主题相关文档组的可检索性分数，然后聚合这些局部值以获得集合级统计量，称为T-Retrievability(主题可检索性)。

Result: 使用T-Retrievability度量分析发现，这种方法能够揭示各种神经排序模型的曝光特性新见解，提供对曝光公平性更细致的理解。

Conclusion: 局部化的T-Retrievability度量提供了更可靠的文档可访问性评估方法，为IR系统的曝光公平性分析提供了更准确的工具。

Abstract: Retrievability of a document is a collection-based statistic that measures
its expected (reciprocal) rank of being retrieved within a specific rank
cut-off. A collection with uniformly distributed retrievability scores across
documents is an indicator of fair document exposure. While retrievability
scores have been used to quantify the fairness of exposure for a collection, in
our work, we use the distribution of retrievability scores to measure the
exposure bias of retrieval models. We hypothesise that an uneven distribution
of retrievability scores across the entire collection may not accurately
reflect exposure bias but rather indicate variations in topical relevance. As a
solution, we propose a topic-focused localised retrievability measure, which we
call \textit{T-Retrievability} (topic-retrievability), which first computes
retrievability scores over multiple groups of topically-related documents, and
then aggregates these localised values to obtain the collection-level
statistics. Our analysis using this proposed T-Retrievability measure uncovers
new insights into the exposure characteristics of various neural ranking
models. The findings suggest that this localised measure provides a more
nuanced understanding of exposure fairness, offering a more reliable approach
for assessing document accessibility in IR systems.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DMGIN是一种新颖的多模态深度分组兴趣网络，通过MLLM对用户点击后行为序列进行高效分组，解决了长序列计算成本高和模态嵌入不兼容的问题，显著提升了CTR预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法处理长点击后行为序列存在计算成本高、效率低的问题，且多模态嵌入与现有大推荐模型架构不匹配，需要一种既能充分利用完整序列上下文又能保持高效的方法。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型(MLLM)对重复项目进行分组重组，通过组内兴趣统计和transformer捕获组特征，再通过组间transformer捕获用户兴趣演化，几乎不增加计算开销。

Result: 在工业和公共数据集上的实验证明DMGIN的有效性和效率，A/B测试显示CTR提升4.7%，每英里收入提升2.3%。

Conclusion: DMGIN通过创新的分组策略成功解决了长序列和多模态嵌入的挑战，在保持高效的同时显著提升了推荐系统的性能表现。

Abstract: Modeling user interest based on lifelong user behavior sequences is crucial
for enhancing Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction. However, long post-click
behavior sequences themselves pose severe performance issues: the sheer volume
of data leads to high computational costs and inefficiencies in model training
and inference. Traditional methods address this by introducing two-stage
approaches, but this compromises model effectiveness due to incomplete
utilization of the full sequence context. More importantly, integrating
multimodal embeddings into existing large recommendation models (LRM) presents
significant challenges: These embeddings often exacerbate computational burdens
and mismatch with LRM architectures. To address these issues and enhance the
model's efficiency and accuracy, we introduce Deep Multimodal Group Interest
Network (DMGIN). Given the observation that user post-click behavior sequences
contain a large number of repeated items with varying behaviors and timestamps,
DMGIN employs Multimodal LLMs(MLLM) for grouping to reorganize complete
lifelong post-click behavior sequences more effectively, with almost no
additional computational overhead, as opposed to directly introducing
multimodal embeddings. To mitigate the potential information loss from
grouping, we have implemented two key strategies. First, we analyze behaviors
within each group using both interest statistics and intra-group transformers
to capture group traits. Second, apply inter-group transformers to temporally
ordered groups to capture the evolution of user group interests. Our extensive
experiments on both industrial and public datasets confirm the effectiveness
and efficiency of DMGIN. The A/B test in our LBS advertising system shows that
DMGIN improves CTR by 4.7% and Revenue per Mile by 2.3%.

Result: 在真实标注数据集上的测试显示，该方法相比基于规则的基线方法性能显著提升，同时保持了规则系统的可解释性，减少了人工审核需求。

Conclusion: 该方法有效填补了调查人员在追踪资金流动时的工具空白，特别适用于制裁调查等只需要调查部分数据的情况，能更好地控制遗漏实体变体的风险。

Abstract: Short text clustering is a known use case in the text analytics community.
When the structure and content falls in the natural language domain e.g.
Twitter posts or instant messages, then natural language techniques can be
used, provided texts are of sufficient length to allow for use of (pre)trained
models to extract meaningful information, such as part-of-speech or topic
annotations. However, natural language models are not suitable for clustering
transaction counterparties, as they are found in bank payment messaging
systems, such as SWIFT. The manually typed tags are typically physical or legal
entity details, which lack sentence structure, while containing all the
variations and noise that manual entry introduces. This leaves a gap in an
investigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment
their knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace
funds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy
matching tools. With these considerations in mind, we are proposing a hybrid
string similarity, topic modelling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based
pipeline to facilitate clustering of transaction counterparties, also catering
for unknown number of expected clusters. We are also devising metrics to
supplement the evaluation of the approach, based on the well-known measures of
precision and recall. Testing on a real-life labelled dataset demonstrates
significantly improved performance over a baseline rule-based ('keyword')
approach. The approach retains most of the interpretability found in rule-based
systems, as the former adds an additional level of cluster refinement to the
latter. The resulting workflow reduces the need for manual review. When only a
subset of the population needs to be investigated, such as in sanctions
investigations, the approach allows for better control of the risks of missing
entity variations.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) marks a fundamental shift in how artificial
intelligence is applied in healthcare. Instead of merely predicting outcomes,
RL actively decides interventions with long term goals. Unlike traditional
models that operate on fixed associations, RL systems learn through trial,
feedback, and long-term reward optimization, introducing transformative
possibilities and new risks. From an information fusion lens, healthcare RL
typically integrates multi-source signals such as vitals, labs clinical notes,
imaging and device telemetry using temporal and decision-level mechanisms.
These systems can operate within centralized, federated, or edge architectures
to meet real-time clinical constraints, and naturally span data, features and
decision fusion levels. This survey explore RL's rise in healthcare as more
than a set of tools, rather a shift toward agentive intelligence in clinical
environments. We first structure the landscape of RL techniques including
model-based and model-free methods, offline and batch-constrained approaches,
and emerging strategies for reward specification and uncertainty calibration
through the lens of healthcare constraints. We then comprehensively analyze RL
applications spanning critical care, chronic disease, mental health,
diagnostics, and robotic assistance, identifying their trends, gaps, and
translational bottlenecks. In contrast to prior reviews, we critically analyze
RL's ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges, and synthesize lessons
for safe, human-aligned policy learning. This paper serves as both a a
technical roadmap and a critical reflection of RL's emerging transformative
role in healthcare AI not as prediction machinery, but as agentive clinical
intelligence.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个多粒度EEG情绪分类框架，在GAMEEMO数据集上使用LSTM-GRU模型取得了优异性能，在二分类、多分类和多标签任务中分别达到0.932 F1分数、94.5%和90.6%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG情绪识别研究大多局限于二分类或特定被试分类，限制了在真实情感计算系统中的泛化能力和部署应用，需要开发更通用的多粒度分类框架。

Method: 使用GAMEEMO数据集（28名被试，14通道EEG），采用时间窗分割、混合统计和频域特征提取、z-score标准化的预处理策略，构建三种情绪标签编码方式，并评估了包括随机森林、XGBoost、SVM以及LSTM、LSTM-GRU、CNN-LSTM等多种机器学习模型。

Result: LSTM-GRU模型表现最佳，在二价分类任务中F1分数达到0.932，在多分类和多标签情绪分类中分别达到94.5%和90.6%的准确率。

Conclusion: 提出的多粒度EEG情绪分类框架有效解决了现有研究的局限性，LSTM-GRU模型在多个分类任务中表现出卓越性能，为真实情感计算系统的部署提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Recent advancements in EEG-based emotion recognition have shown promising
outcomes using both deep learning and classical machine learning approaches;
however, most existing studies focus narrowly on binary valence prediction or
subject-specific classification, which limits generalizability and deployment
in real-world affective computing systems. To address this gap, this paper
presents a unified, multigranularity EEG emotion classification framework built
on the GAMEEMO dataset, which consists of 14-channel EEG recordings and
continuous self-reported emotion ratings (boring, horrible, calm, and funny)
from 28 subjects across four emotion-inducing gameplay scenarios. Our pipeline
employs a structured preprocessing strategy that comprises temporal window
segmentation, hybrid statistical and frequency-domain feature extraction, and
z-score normalization to convert raw EEG signals into robust, discriminative
input vectors. Emotion labels are derived and encoded across three
complementary axes: (i) binary valence classification based on the averaged
polarity of positive and negative emotion ratings, and (ii) Multi-class emotion
classification, where the presence of the most affective state is predicted.
(iii) Fine-grained multi-label representation via binning each emotion into 10
ordinal classes. We evaluate a broad spectrum of models, including Random
Forest, XGBoost, and SVM, alongside deep neural architectures such as LSTM,
LSTM-GRU, and CNN-LSTM. Among these, the LSTM-GRU model consistently
outperforms the others, achieving an F1-score of 0.932 in the binary valence
task and 94.5% and 90.6% in both multi-class and Multi-Label emotion
classification.

Conclusion: PVPO通过优势参考锚点和数据预采样机制，有效解决了无critic强化学习方法的局限性，实现了高效且可扩展的强化学习

Abstract: Critic-free reinforcement learning methods, particularly group policies, have
attracted considerable attention for their efficiency in complex tasks.
However, these methods rely heavily on multiple sampling and comparisons within
the policy to estimate advantage, which may cause the policy to fall into local
optimum and increase computational cost. To address these issues, we propose
PVPO, an efficient reinforcement learning method enhanced by an advantage
reference anchor and data pre-sampling. Specifically, we use the reference
model to rollout in advance and employ the calculated reward score as a
reference anchor. Our approach effectively corrects the cumulative bias
introduced by intra-group comparisons and significantly reduces reliance on the
number of rollouts. Meanwhile, the reference model can assess sample difficulty
during data pre-sampling, enabling effective selection of high-gain data to
improve training efficiency. Experiments conducted on nine datasets across two
domains demonstrate that PVPO achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance. Our
approach not only demonstrates robust generalization across multiple tasks, but
also exhibits scalable performance across models of varying scales.

TL;DR: AdaGram是一种高效的全矩阵自适应梯度优化器，通过快速对称分解和矩阵积分器方法降低计算和内存开销，在标准机器学习任务中比对角自适应优化器收敛更快或性能相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自适应梯度方法（如Adagrad）使用对角预处理矩阵，无法捕捉参数相关性。全矩阵自适应方法虽然能建模这些相关性，但计算和内存成本过高，限制了在大规模模型中的应用。

Method: 提出AdaGram优化器，采用快速对称分解计算预处理更新方向，并使用矩阵积分器方法保持预处理器的低秩结构，从而降低内存和计算开销。

Result: 在标准机器学习任务上的数值实验表明，AdaGram在使用秩五及更小秩近似时，收敛速度比对角自适应优化器更快或性能相当。

Conclusion: AdaGram为大规模模型中的自适应优化提供了一个可扩展的解决方案，能够有效捕捉参数相关性同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods like Adagrad and its variants are widespread in
large-scale optimization. However, their use of diagonal preconditioning
matrices limits the ability to capture parameter correlations. Full-matrix
adaptive methods, approximating the exact Hessian, can model these correlations
and may enable faster convergence. At the same time, their computational and
memory costs are often prohibitive for large-scale models. To address this
limitation, we propose AdaGram, an optimizer that enables efficient full-matrix
adaptive gradient updates. To reduce memory and computational overhead, we
utilize fast symmetric factorization for computing the preconditioned update
direction at each iteration. Additionally, we maintain the low-rank structure
of a preconditioner along the optimization trajectory using matrix integrator
methods. Numerical experiments on standard machine learning tasks show that
AdaGram converges faster or matches the performance of diagonal adaptive
optimizers when using rank five and smaller rank approximations. This
demonstrates AdaGram's potential as a scalable solution for adaptive
optimization in large models.

Abstract: This paper presents a Deep Learning (DL) framework for 48-hour forecasting of
temperature, solar irradiance, and relative humidity to support Model
Predictive Control (MPC) in smart HVAC systems. The approach employs a stacked
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network with attention, capturing
temporal and cross-feature dependencies by jointly predicting all three
variables. Historical meteorological data (2019-2022) with encoded cyclical
time features were used for training, while 2023 data evaluated generalization.
The model achieved Mean Absolute Errors of 1.3 degrees Celsius (temperature),
31 W/m2 (irradiance), and 6.7 percentage points (humidity), outperforming
state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction and machine learning benchmarks.
Integrated Gradients quantified feature contributions, and attention weights
revealed temporal patterns, enhancing interpretability. By combining
multivariate forecasting, attention-based DL, and explainability, this work
advances data-driven weather prediction. The demonstrated accuracy and
transparency highlight the framework's potential for energy-efficient building
control through reliable short-term meteorological forecasting.

Motivation: NASA深空网络设备随时间退化可能导致数据流中断，威胁航天器连接，需要开发自动异常检测方法来辅助工程师维护操作

Method: 研究多种机器学习技术进行数据重建和预测分析，结合强化学习子系统分类异常严重程度，使用大型语言模型生成异常解释，构建完整数据管道系统

Conclusion: 通过AI代理系统包装的完整异常检测解决方案，能够识别设备退化并进行分类预测，为未来太空任务提供可靠的DSN维护支持

Abstract: The Deep Space Network (DSN) is NASA's largest network of antenna facilities
that generate a large volume of multivariate time-series data. These facilities
contain DSN antennas and transmitters that undergo degradation over long
periods of time, which may cause costly disruptions to the data flow and
threaten the earth-connection of dozens of spacecraft that rely on the Deep
Space Network for their lifeline. The purpose of this study was to experiment
with different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly
pinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and
continue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space
missions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine
learning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive
analysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets
through statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained
and tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a
reinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on
severity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each
anomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time
through human feedback/input. Specifically, for the DSN transmitters, we have
also implemented a full data pipeline system that connects the data extraction,
parsing, and processing workflow all together as there was no coherent program
or script for performing these tasks before. Using this data pipeline system,
we were able to then also connect the models trained from DSN antenna data,
completing the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection. This was all wrapped
around and further connected by an agentic AI system, where complex reasoning
was utilized to determine the classifications and predictions of anomalous
data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出PILOT方法，将LLM路由建模为上下文多臂老虎机问题，通过共享嵌入空间和在线学习实现自适应路由选择，同时考虑成本约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由方法假设已知最优查询-模型配对，但现实场景缺乏完整映射且查询动态变化，需要自适应决策方法。

Method: 构建查询和LLM的共享嵌入空间，使用离线人类偏好数据初始化，通过LinUCB扩展算法PILOT进行在线学习，并引入多选择背包问题处理成本约束。

Result: 提出的PILOT方法能够在不需要对所有LLM进行完整推理的情况下，通过上下文老虎机反馈实现自适应路由选择，同时满足资源效率要求。

Conclusion: 将LLM路由建模为上下文老虎机问题是有效的，PILOT方法通过结合离线和在线学习，实现了在动态环境中的高效自适应路由决策。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
but their varying capabilities and costs pose challenges in practical
applications. LLM routing addresses this by dynamically selecting the most
suitable LLM for each query/task. Previous approaches treat this as a
supervised learning problem, assuming complete knowledge of optimal query-LLM
pairings. However, real-world scenarios lack such comprehensive mappings and
face evolving user queries. We thus propose to study LLM routing as a
contextual bandit problem, enabling adaptive decision-making using bandit
feedback without requiring exhaustive inference across all LLMs for all queries
(in contrast to supervised routing). To address this problem, we develop a
shared embedding space for queries and LLMs, where query and LLM embeddings are
aligned to reflect their affinity. This space is initially learned from offline
human preference data and refined through online bandit feedback. We
instantiate this idea through Preference-prior Informed Linucb fOr adaptive
rouTing (PILOT), a novel extension of LinUCB. To handle diverse user budgets
for model routing, we introduce an online cost policy modeled as a multi-choice
knapsack problem, ensuring resource-efficient routing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的生成模型成员推理攻击方法Gen-LRA，专门针对表格生成模型在训练分布某些区域显著过拟合的特性，无需模型知识或访问权限即可有效检测合成数据发布中的隐私泄露风险。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的合成数据隐私审计框架大多依赖启发式方法和不合理假设，在检测生成模型训练数据隐私泄露方面能力有限，需要更有效的隐私审计工具。

Method: 提出了生成似然比攻击(Gen-LRA)，这是一种无需模型知识的黑盒攻击方法，通过评估测试观测对替代模型估计合成数据局部似然比的影响来构建攻击。

Result: 在涵盖多样化数据集、模型架构和攻击参数的全面基准测试中，Gen-LRA在多个性能指标上始终优于其他生成模型MIAs方法。

Conclusion: Gen-LRA作为合成数据发布的隐私审计工具非常有效，突显了生成模型过拟合在现实应用中带来的重大隐私风险。

Abstract: Auditing the privacy leakage of synthetic data is an important but unresolved
problem. Most existing privacy auditing frameworks for synthetic data rely on
heuristics and unreasonable assumptions to attack the failure modes of
generative models, exhibiting limited capability to describe and detect the
privacy exposure of training data through synthetic data release. In this
paper, we study designing Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) that specifically
exploit the observation that tabular generative models tend to significantly
overfit to certain regions of the training distribution. Here, we propose
Generative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA), a novel, computationally
efficient No-Box MIA that, with no assumption of model knowledge or access,
formulates its attack by evaluating the influence a test observation has in a
surrogate model's estimation of a local likelihood ratio over the synthetic
data. Assessed over a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attack parameters, we find that Gen-LRA consistently
dominates other MIAs for generative models across multiple performance metrics.
These results underscore Gen-LRA's effectiveness as a privacy auditing tool for
the release of synthetic data, highlighting the significant privacy risks posed
by generative model overfitting in real-world applications.

Result: 在多种时间序列任务上的实验表明，该方法优于传统的浅层和深度储备池计算

Conclusion: DeepResESNs通过残差连接有效提升了长期时间建模能力，为未训练循环神经网络提供了新的深度架构设计思路

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a particular type of untrained Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) within the Reservoir Computing (RC) framework, popular
for their fast and efficient learning. However, traditional ESNs often struggle
with long-term information processing. In this paper, we introduce a novel
class of deep untrained RNNs based on temporal residual connections, called
Deep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs). We show that leveraging a
hierarchy of untrained residual recurrent layers significantly boosts memory
capacity and long-term temporal modeling. For the temporal residual
connections, we consider different orthogonal configurations, including
randomly generated and fixed-structure configurations, and we study their
effect on network dynamics. A thorough mathematical analysis outlines necessary
and sufficient conditions to ensure stable dynamics within DeepResESN. Our
experiments on a variety of time series tasks showcase the advantages of the
proposed approach over traditional shallow and deep RC.

Conclusion: FUTURE提供了一种有效且高效的树集成遗忘解决方案，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Tree ensembles are widely recognized for their effectiveness in
classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse
domains, including bioinformatics, finance, and medical diagnosis. With
increasing emphasis on data privacy and the \textit{right to be forgotten},
several unlearning algorithms have been proposed to enable tree ensembles to
forget sensitive information. However, existing methods are often tailored to a
particular model or rely on the discrete tree structure, making them difficult
to generalize to complex ensembles and inefficient for large-scale datasets. To
address these limitations, we propose FUTURE, a novel unlearning algorithm for
tree ensembles. Specifically, we formulate the problem of forgetting samples as
a gradient-based optimization task. In order to accommodate
non-differentiability of tree ensembles, we adopt the probabilistic model
approximations within the optimization framework. This enables end-to-end
unlearning in an effective and efficient manner. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets show that FUTURE yields significant and successful
unlearning performance.

*Christopher R. Lee-Jenkins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文从变分原理角度重新解释LLM解码过程，将next-token分布视为概率单纯形上的约束优化问题，证明其遵循平滑轨迹收敛到softmax均衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对大型语言模型解码过程的描述多停留在评分和softmax归一化的层面，缺乏严格的数学框架来理解输出分布随时间的演化轨迹

Method: 使用约束变分原理和概率单纯形上的乘性权重（熵镜像）更新方法，分析连续时间极限下的复制子流，建立解码过程的数学理论框架

Result: 证明了在固定上下文和温度下，next-token分布沿平滑轨迹收敛到softmax均衡；温度是时间的精确缩放，top-k和nucleus采样限制在特定面上具有相同保证

Conclusion: 为解码过程提供了严格的数学基础，形式化了"流形遍历"直觉，对温度调节和采样方法给出了精确的理论解释，为理解路径依赖的分数调整和幻觉行为奠定了基础

Abstract: Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and
normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this
step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The
discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical
multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is
the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context
and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside
the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the
common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The
analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an
exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus
sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline
a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection
to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training
dynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work.

TL;DR: 研究发现，大语言模型强化学习中的反直觉现象（如单样本训练效果、不精确奖励信号的有效性等）主要出现在模型与任务已经高度对齐的情况下，而在更具挑战性的场景中，标准RL方法仍然更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究发现LLM强化学习中出现了一系列反直觉现象，但这些现象的有效条件尚不明确，需要系统研究其适用范围和限制。

Method: 通过系统全面的实验验证，在不同模型架构和任务领域检验一系列反直觉主张，重点关注模型-任务对齐程度（用pass@k准确率衡量）的影响。

Result: 实验表明，标准RL训练在各种设置下都保持稳健，而许多反直觉结果仅在模型与任务已经表现出强对齐时才会出现。在更具挑战性的情况下，这些技术无法驱动实质性学习。

Conclusion: 模型-任务对齐程度是区分RL观察结果的关键因素，反直觉现象的有效性高度依赖于预训练模型与任务的对齐质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to large language
models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress. In particular, a series of
remarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs,
exhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For
example, notable claims include that a single training example can match the
performance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not
need to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can
match or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise
conditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they
fail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that
differentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits
strong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated
task. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of
counterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across
different model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while
standard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these
counterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit
strong model-task alignment. In contrast, these techniques fail to drive
substantial learning in more challenging regimes, where standard RL methods
remain effective.

Method: 提出新的问题表述，分析各种最小化技术，并研究影响其有效性的关键因素，进行可行性研究。

Result: 证明在技术上可以大幅减少推断数据而不造成显著的性能损失。

Conclusion: 虽然技术上是可行的，但数据最小化在实际应用中仍然具有挑战性，其对技术和用户环境的依赖性使得制定通用的数据'必要性'标准难以实施。

Abstract: Data minimization is a legal principle requiring personal data processing to
be limited to what is necessary for a specified purpose. Operationalizing this
principle for recommender systems, which rely on extensive personal data,
remains a significant challenge. This paper conducts a feasibility study on
minimizing implicit feedback inference data for such systems. We propose a
novel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and
investigate key factors influencing their effectiveness. We demonstrate that
substantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without
significant performance loss. However, its practicality is critically
determined by two factors: the technical setting (e.g., performance targets,
choice of model) and user characteristics (e.g., history size, preference
complexity). Thus, while we establish its technical feasibility, we conclude
that data minimization remains practically challenging and its dependence on
the technical and user context makes a universal standard for data `necessity'
difficult to implement.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel generative continual learning framework based on
self-organizing maps (SOMs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to enable
memory-efficient replay, eliminating the need to store raw data samples or task
labels. For high-dimensional input spaces, such as of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
we design a scheme where the SOM operates over the latent space learned by a
VAE, whereas, for lower-dimensional inputs, such as those found in MNIST and
FashionMNIST, the SOM operates in a standalone fashion. Our method stores a
running mean, variance, and covariance for each SOM unit, from which synthetic
samples are then generated during future learning iterations. For the VAE-based
method, generated samples are then fed through the decoder to then be used in
subsequent replay. Experimental results on standard class-incremental
benchmarks show that our approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art
memory-based methods and outperforms memory-free methods, notably improving
over best state-of-the-art single class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100 by nearly $10$\% and $7$\%, respectively. Our methodology further
facilitates easy visualization of the learning process and can also be utilized
as a generative model post-training. Results show our method's capability as a
scalable, task-label-free, and memory-efficient solution for continual
learning.

Conclusion: MoE框架通过协同整合专用架构的互补优势，为创建更鲁棒和准确的复合代理模型提供了强大有效的策略

Abstract: The computational cost associated with high-fidelity CFD simulations remains
a significant bottleneck in the automotive design and optimization cycle. While
ML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate
aerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly
evolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single
model demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel
meta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a
strength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated
gating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three
heterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable
multi-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph
neural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution
network. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy,
assigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in
predicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model
collapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy
regularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is
trained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark
of high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative
results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2
prediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most
accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities. This
work establishes the MoE framework as a powerful and effective strategy for
creating more robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically
combining the complementary strengths of specialized architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Relevance Patching (RelP)方法，通过使用Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)的传播系数替代传统梯度，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了激活修补的准确性和可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的激活修补方法计算成本高，而基于梯度的属性修补方法在深度非线性网络中存在噪声和可靠性降低的问题，需要一种既高效又准确的方法

Method: 使用Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)的传播系数替代传统梯度，通过两个前向传播和一个反向传播实现，保持了计算效率

Result: 在GPT-2 Large模型的IOI任务中，RelP达到了0.956的皮尔逊相关系数，远高于传统属性修补的0.006，且在稀疏特征电路识别中与Integrated Gradients达到相当的信度但计算成本更低

Conclusion: RelP方法在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了激活修补的准确性和可靠性，为大规模模型的机制解释提供了一种更有效的工具

Abstract: Activation patching is a standard method in mechanistic interpretability for
localizing the components of a model responsible for specific behaviors, but it
is computationally expensive to apply at scale. Attribution patching offers a
faster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced
reliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduce
Relevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution
patching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the
layers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local
propagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or
improved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only
two forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency
while improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and
tasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than
standard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and
MLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for
MLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation
of 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by
RelP. Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuits
identified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achieves
comparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated with
IG.

TL;DR: FedOwen是一个高效的联邦学习框架，使用Owen采样近似Shapley值，在相同评估预算下比现有方法误差更小，并通过自适应客户端选择策略实现更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中准确估计客户端贡献对于公平奖励和选择最有用的客户端至关重要，但精确计算Shapley值在客户端数量大时计算复杂度呈指数增长，不可行。

Method: 提出FedOwen框架，使用Owen采样近似Shapley值，采用自适应客户端选择策略平衡利用高价值客户端和探索未充分采样的客户端。

Result: 在固定评估成本下，FedOwen在非IID基准测试中相比最先进基线方法，在相同通信轮数内实现了高达23%的最终准确率提升。

Conclusion: FedOwen通过高效的Shapley值近似和智能客户端选择，显著提高了联邦学习的效率和性能，特别是在非IID数据场景下。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aggregates information from multiple clients to train
a shared global model without exposing raw data. Accurately estimating each
client's contribution is essential not just for fair rewards, but for selecting
the most useful clients so the global model converges faster. The Shapley value
is a principled choice, yet exact computation scales exponentially with the
number of clients, making it infeasible for large federations. We propose
FedOwen, an efficient framework that uses Owen sampling to approximate Shapley
values under the same total evaluation budget as existing methods while keeping
the approximation error small. In addition, FedOwen uses an adaptive client
selection strategy that balances exploiting high-value clients with exploring
under-sampled ones, reducing bias and uncovering rare but informative data.
Under a fixed valuation cost, FedOwen achieves up to 23 percent higher final
accuracy within the same number of communication rounds compared to
state-of-the-art baselines on non-IID benchmarks.

### [147] [Guess-and-Learn (G&L): Measuring the Cumulative Error Cost of Cold-Start Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21270)
*Roland Arnold*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: G&L v1.0提出评估机器学习模型冷启动适应性的新框架，通过测量模型从未标注数据集中顺序学习时累积的错误来评估适应成本，而不仅仅是最终准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型评估过于强调最终准确率，忽略了学习过程中的适应成本（累积错误）。需要量化模型从零开始学习时的早期错误成本，以开发更可靠的学习器。

Method: 设计Guess-and-Learn协议：学习器逐步选择实例、预测标签、接收真实标签并更新参数（在线或批量模式）。定义四个轨道（Scratch/Pretrained × Online/Batch）来分离初始化和更新频率的影响。

Result: 在MNIST和AG News上的实验显示：小模型能以更少初始错误适应，预训练效果因领域而异。所有当前模型都远高于oracle参考带，存在明显的适应性差距。

Conclusion: G&L通过量化早期学习的错误成本，补充了传统基准测试，为开发既准确又从一开始就可靠的学习器提供了可复现框架。

Abstract: Evaluation of machine learning models typically emphasizes final accuracy,
overlooking the cost of adaptation: the cumulative errors incurred while
learning from scratch. Guess-and- Learn (G&L) v1.0 addresses this gap by
measuring cold-start adaptability - the total mistakes a model makes while
sequentially labeling an unlabeled dataset. At each step, the learner selects
an instance, predicts its label, receives the ground truth, and updates
parameters under either online (per-sample) or batch (delayed) mode. The
resulting error trajectory exposes adaptation speed, selection quality, and
bias - dynamics invisible to endpoint metrics.
  G&L defines four tracks (Scratch/Pretrained $\times$ Online/Batch) to
disentangle the effects of initialization and update frequency. We formalize
the protocol, relate it to classical mistake-bound theory, and estimate a
heuristic "oracle reference band" for MNIST as a plausibility reference.
Baseline experiments on MNIST and AG News, spanning classical methods
(Perceptron, k-NN), convolutional architectures (CNN, ResNet-50), and
pretrained transformers (ViT-B/16, BERT-base), reveal systematic differences in
early-phase efficiency: smaller models can adapt with fewer initial errors,
while pretraining benefits vary by domain. Across settings, current models
remain well above the oracle band, highlighting an adaptability gap.
  By quantifying the mistake cost of early learning, G&L complements
conventional benchmarks and provides a reproducible framework for developing
learners that are not only accurate in the limit but also reliable from the
first examples.

*Ashok Devireddy,Shunping Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CALM框架：基于Apache Beam和TimesFm的实时异常检测系统，通过持续微调和LLM辅助判断来应对概念漂移问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离线训练的异常检测模型在面对非平稳时间序列流中的概念漂移时性能显著下降，需要开发能够实时适应数据变化的解决方案

Method: 构建基于Apache Beam分布式处理框架的端到端系统，使用TimesFm基础模型进行预测式异常检测，采用闭环持续微调机制和LLM-as-a-Judge组件进行语义判断

Result: 在TSB-UAD基准测试中，持续微调模型相比静态预训练基础模型在大多数数据集上提高了ROC AUC分数

Conclusion: CALM框架通过自适应和LLM引导的方法，在动态流环境中有效维持了高性能异常检测能力

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in non-stationary time-series streams is a
critical but challenging task across numerous industrial and scientific
domains. Traditional models, trained offline, suffer significant performance
degradation when faced with concept drift, where the underlying statistical
properties of the data change over time. This paper introduces CALM
(Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated), a novel, end-to-end framework for
real-time anomaly detection designed to address this challenge. CALM is built
on the Apache Beam distributed processing framework and leverages the TimesFm
foundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection. The framework's
novelty lies in two core contributions. First, it implements a closed-loop,
continuous fine-tuning mechanism that allows the anomaly detection model to
adapt to evolving data patterns in near real-time. Second, it introduces an
LLM-as-a-Judge component, a Large Language Model that provides semantic,
context-aware judgments on detected anomalies to curate a high-quality training
dataset, deciding whether an anomaly represents transient noise or a meaningful
pattern shift. We evaluate CALM on the comprehensive TSB-UAD benchmark. Our
results demonstrate that the continuously fine-tuned model improves the ROC AUC
score in most datasets compared to the static, pre-trained base model,
validating the efficacy of our adaptive, LLM-guided approach to maintaining
high-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨使用数据流学习技术检测肌电信号中的域偏移，通过KPCA预处理和多种漂移检测方法评估，发现现有技术在实时EMG域偏移检测中存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肌电信号固有的非平稳性使得域偏移检测成为重大挑战，需要开发有效的方法来维持稳定的EMG解码模型。

Method: 使用KPCA（余弦核）预处理Ninapro数据库的DB6数据集，评估CUSUM、Page-Hinckley和ADWIN等多种漂移检测方法。

Result: 当前技术在实时EMG信号域偏移检测中性能有限，未能实现高精度检测。

Conclusion: 基于流式学习的方法在维持稳定EMG解码模型方面具有潜力，但需要进一步研究来提高鲁棒性和实际应用准确性。

Abstract: Detecting domain shifts in myoelectric activations poses a significant
challenge due to the inherent non-stationarity of electromyography (EMG)
signals. This paper explores the detection of domain shifts using data stream
(DS) learning techniques, focusing on the DB6 dataset from the Ninapro
database. We define domains as distinct time-series segments based on different
subjects and recording sessions, applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis
(KPCA) with a cosine kernel to pre-process and highlight these shifts. By
evaluating multiple drift detection methods such as CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, and
ADWIN, we reveal the limitations of current techniques in achieving high
performance for real-time domain shift detection in EMG signals. Our results
underscore the potential of streaming-based approaches for maintaining stable
EMG decoding models, while highlighting areas for further research to enhance
robustness and accuracy in real-world scenarios.

*Shihao Ji,Zihui Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MyGO是一个受生物睡眠-觉醒周期启发的终身学习框架，通过生成模型存储任务分布，在离线阶段生成伪数据来巩固新旧知识，无需存储原始数据，解决了隐私和存储问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续学习中灾难性遗忘问题，现有方法依赖存储样本或复杂正则化，面临数据隐私、存储限制和任务差异导致的性能下降等挑战。

Method: 采用觉醒-睡眠双阶段：觉醒阶段快速学习新任务并训练紧凑生成模型；睡眠阶段离线生成伪数据，通过知识蒸馏将新旧知识整合到核心特征提取器中。

Result: 在计算机视觉和自然语言处理基准测试中，MyGO显著缓解了灾难性遗忘，保持了跨任务的高平均准确率。

Conclusion: MyGO框架有效解决了持续学习中的关键挑战，具有隐私保护、存储高效和领域通用性等优势。

Abstract: Continual or Lifelong Learning aims to develop models capable of acquiring
new knowledge from a sequence of tasks without catastrophically forgetting what
has been learned before. Existing approaches often rely on storing samples from
previous tasks (experience replay) or employing complex regularization terms to
protect learned weights. However, these methods face challenges related to data
privacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are
dissimilar. To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding
Generative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired
by the biological wake-sleep cycle. During the "wake" phase, the system rapidly
learns a new task and trains a compact generative model (Generative Memory,
G-mem) to capture its data distribution. During the "sleep" phase, the system
enters an offline state, using all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data
("dreams") and consolidate new and old knowledge into a core feature extractor
via knowledge distillation. This approach obviates the need to store any raw
data, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant
advantages in privacy and storage efficiency. We evaluate MyGO on computer
vision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News)
benchmarks, comparing it against a sequential fine-tuning baseline. The results
demonstrate that MyGO significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and
maintains high average accuracy across tasks, proving the framework's
effectiveness and domain-generality.

### [151] [Improving Fisher Information Estimation and Efficiency for LoRA-based LLM Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21300)
*Yejin Kim,Eunwon Kim,Buru Chang,Junsuk Choe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VILA是一种新的机器学习遗忘框架，通过改进FILA方法中Fisher信息的假设处理，提高了敏感参数识别的准确性，同时大幅降低了计算成本，实现了100倍的参数效率和40倍的训练速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在生成输出时可能泄露敏感信息的问题，传统重训练方法计算成本过高，而现有的FILA方法虽然参数高效但仍需访问全部模型参数且Fisher信息假设处理不准确。

Method: 提出VILA框架，显式考虑FILA忽略的Fisher信息基本假设，提高遗忘集参数识别准确性；通过无需访问整个模型的方式显著降低计算成本。

Result: 在TOFU、WMDP和MUSE基准测试中达到state-of-the-art性能，相比FILA实现100倍参数效率提升和40倍训练速度提升。

Conclusion: VILA通过改进参数识别准确性和计算效率，为LLMs的安全部署提供了有效的敏感信息遗忘解决方案，在性能和效率方面均显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but face
challenges related to unintentionally generating outputs containing sensitive
information. A straightforward approach to address this issue is to retrain the
model after excluding the problematic data. However, this approach incurs
prohibitively high computational costs. To overcome this limitation, machine
unlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove
sensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch.
Recently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by
integrating LoRA adapters. Specifically, it calculates the Fisher information
to identify parameters associated with the forget set and assigns them to LoRA
adapters for updates. Despite its innovative approach, FILA still requires
access to all model parameters and does not adequately account for fundamental
assumptions underlying Fisher information, leading to inaccuracies in
importance estimation. To address these limitations, we propose VILA, a novel
unlearning framework that explicitly considers the assumptions overlooked in
FILA, thereby enhancing the accuracy of parameter identification for the forget
set. Moreover, VILA significantly reduces computational costs by enabling
parameter identification without accessing the entire model. Our method
achieves up to 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training speed
compared to FILA, and sets new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks
including TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE. Our code is available at
https://github.com/kyj93790/VILA.

*Amit Sinha,Matthieu Geist,Aditya Mahajan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个分析Q-learning算法收敛性的框架，针对使用代理状态（非信念状态）和策略正则化的常见实践算法，证明了在温和条件下收敛到正则化MDP的固定点


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解实际应用中常用的Q-learning强化学习算法的收敛性，这些算法通常使用代理状态（如RNN状态）进行递归更新，并采用策略正则化来促进探索和稳定学习

Method: 研究最简单的正则化代理状态Q-learning算法（RASQL），分析其收敛性，并扩展到学习周期性策略的变体，通过数值实验验证理论结果

Result: 证明RASQL在温和技术条件下收敛到适当定义的正则化MDP的固定点，该固定点取决于行为策略诱导的平稳分布，数值实验显示经验收敛行为与理论极限匹配

Conclusion: 为实际Q-learning算法提供了理论收敛保证，证明了使用代理状态和策略正则化的算法能够收敛到正则化MDP的固定点，为实践中的算法设计提供了理论基础

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework to understand the convergence of
commonly used Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithms in practice. Two
salient features of such algorithms are: (i)~the Q-table is recursively updated
using an agent state (such as the state of a recurrent neural network) which is
not a belief state or an information state and (ii)~policy regularization is
often used to encourage exploration and stabilize the learning algorithm. We
investigate the simplest form of such Q-learning algorithms which we call
regularized agent-state-based Q-learning (RASQL) and show that it converges
under mild technical conditions to the fixed point of an appropriately defined
regularized MDP, which depends on the stationary distribution induced by the
behavioral policy. We also show that a similar analysis continues to work for a
variant of RASQL that learns periodic policies. We present numerical examples
to illustrate that the empirical convergence behavior matches with the proposed
theoretical limit.

### [153] [Distribution-Aware Feature Selection for SAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21324)
*Narmeen Oozeer,Nirmalendu Prakash,Michael Lan,Alice Rigg,Amirali Abdullah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sampled-SAE是一种改进的稀疏自编码器方法，通过采样策略在批次级别和令牌级别特征选择之间提供可调节的平衡，解决了传统TopK SAE和BatchTopK方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TopK SAE对每个令牌使用固定的K个最活跃特征，效率低下；BatchTopK方法虽然提高了平均重建效果，但存在"激活彩票"问题，即罕见的高幅值特征会挤掉更有信息量但幅值较低的特征。

Method: 提出Sampled-SAE方法：对批次激活矩阵的列（特征）进行评分（使用L2范数或熵），形成大小为Kl的候选池，然后应用Top-K从受限的特征池中选择批次中的令牌。通过调节l参数在批次级别和令牌特定选择之间形成连续谱。

Result: 在Pythia-160M模型上的实验表明，没有单一的l值能在所有指标上达到最优，最佳选择取决于共享结构、重建保真度和下游性能之间的权衡。

Conclusion: Sampled-SAE将BatchTopK重新构建为一个可调节的、分布感知的方法家族，提供了在全局一致性和细粒度重建之间的灵活权衡。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose neural activations into interpretable
features. A widely adopted variant, the TopK SAE, reconstructs each token from
its K most active latents. However, this approach is inefficient, as some
tokens carry more information than others. BatchTopK addresses this limitation
by selecting top activations across a batch of tokens. This improves average
reconstruction but risks an "activation lottery," where rare high-magnitude
features crowd out more informative but lower-magnitude ones. To address this
issue, we introduce Sampled-SAE: we score the columns (representing features)
of the batch activation matrix (via $L_2$ norm or entropy), forming a candidate
pool of size $Kl$, and then apply Top-$K$ to select tokens across the batch
from the restricted pool of features. Varying $l$ traces a spectrum between
batch-level and token-specific selection. At $l=1$, tokens draw only from $K$
globally influential features, while larger $l$ expands the pool toward
standard BatchTopK and more token-specific features across the batch. Small $l$
thus enforces global consistency; large $l$ favors fine-grained reconstruction.
On Pythia-160M, no single value optimizes $l$ across all metrics: the best
choice depends on the trade-off between shared structure, reconstruction
fidelity, and downstream performance. Sampled-SAE thus reframes BatchTopK as a
tunable, distribution-aware family.

TL;DR: Stage-Diff是一个基于扩散模型的分阶段生成模型，专门用于生成长时间序列，通过分阶段生成和跨阶段信息传递来平衡长期依赖性和数据分布漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时间序列具有复杂的长期时间模式和分布漂移，同时包含复杂的特征序列间相互关系，现有生成模型在处理这些挑战时存在困难。

Method: 提出Stage-Diff模型：1）分阶段序列生成和跨阶段信息传递，保持长期依赖并建模分布漂移；2）每阶段内进行渐进序列分解，在不同时间尺度进行通道独立建模；3）跨阶段信息传递采用多通道融合建模。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上的大量实验验证了Stage-Diff在长时间序列生成任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: Stage-Diff通过结合通道独立建模的鲁棒性和多通道建模的信息融合优势，有效平衡了长时间序列的序列内和序列间依赖关系。

Abstract: Generative models have been successfully used in the field of time series
generation. However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over
extended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task
of generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series
exhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also
undergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term
dependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the
other hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships
between different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing
both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important
challenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative
model for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through
stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model
preserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data
distribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence
decomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different
time scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel
fusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent
modeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling,
effectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of
long-term time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets
validate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation
tasks.

Motivation: 现有时间序列合成方法基于随机序列进行时间建模，难以保证生成时间序列的时间依赖性，且难以准确捕获原始时间序列的特征信息。

Method: 提出DLGAN模型，将时间序列生成分解为序列特征提取和序列重建两个阶段，形成完整的时间序列自编码器，并使用GAN生成与真实序列特征向量对齐的合成特征向量。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的大量实验表明，该模型在各种评估指标上都表现出优越性。

Conclusion: DLGAN是一个简单但有效的生成模型，能够有效解决时间序列合成中的时间依赖性和特征捕获问题，在多个数据集上表现优异。

Abstract: Time series synthesis is an effective approach to ensuring the secure
circulation of time series data. Existing time series synthesis methods
typically perform temporal modeling based on random sequences to generate
target sequences, which often struggle to ensure the temporal dependencies in
the generated time series. Additionally, directly modeling temporal features on
random sequences makes it challenging to accurately capture the feature
information of the original time series. To address the above issues, we
propose a simple but effective generative model \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{L}ayer
\textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{N}etworks, named
\textbf{DLGAN}. The model decomposes the time series generation process into
two stages: sequence feature extraction and sequence reconstruction. First,
these two stages form a complete time series autoencoder, enabling supervised
learning on the original time series to ensure that the reconstruction process
can restore the temporal dependencies of the sequence. Second, a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to generate synthetic feature vectors that
align with the real-time sequence feature vectors, ensuring that the generator
can capture the temporal features from real time series. Extensive experiments
on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of this model across
various evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: AHTSGD是第一个基于稳定性边缘现象调整注入噪声性质的算法，在干净和噪声设置下都能改善泛化性能，且对学习率选择具有鲁棒性

Abstract: In the era of large-scale neural network models, optimization algorithms
often struggle with generalization due to an overreliance on training loss. One
key insight widely accepted in the machine learning community is the idea that
wide basins (regions around a local minimum where the loss increases gradually)
promote better generalization by offering greater stability to small changes in
input data or model parameters. In contrast, sharp minima are typically more
sensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the
inherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient
descent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in
which curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy
Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects
heavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to
enhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as
sharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss
landscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide
basins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise
into an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. AHTSGD
consistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks like
MNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisy datasets such as SVHN. It
ultimately accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves
generalization across clean and noisy settings, remaining robust to learning
rate choices.

Method: 扩展logit lens技术分析Leela Chess Zero策略网络，研究各层在棋力和解谜能力上的表现趋势。

Result: 发现棋力和解谜能力呈现强单调增长趋势，但策略分布经常遵循非平滑轨迹，包括正确解早期发现后被丢弃、走法排名与最终输出相关性差、策略高度发散直到网络后期。

Conclusion: 神经网络表示构建过程在不同任务领域存在显著差异，国际象棋AI展现出与语言模型平滑分布收敛不同的复杂非单调特征。

Abstract: Do neural networks build their representations through smooth, gradual
refinement, or via more complex computational processes? We investigate this by
extending the logit lens to analyze the policy network of Leela Chess Zero, a
superhuman chess engine. We find strong monotonic trends in playing strength
and puzzle-solving ability across layers, yet policy distributions frequently
follow non-smooth trajectories. Evidence for this includes correct puzzle
solutions that are discovered early but subsequently discarded, move rankings
that remain poorly correlated with final outputs, and high policy divergence
until late in the network. These findings contrast with the smooth
distributional convergence typically observed in language models.

Abstract: We introduce PMODE (Partitioned Mixture Of Density Estimators), a general and
modular framework for mixture modeling with both parametric and nonparametric
components. PMODE builds mixtures by partitioning the data and fitting separate
estimators to each subset. It attains near-optimal rates for this estimator
class and remains valid even when the mixture components come from different
distribution families. As an application, we develop MV-PMODE, which scales a
previously theoretical approach to high-dimensional density estimation to
settings with thousands of dimensions. Despite its simplicity, it performs
competitively against deep baselines on CIFAR-10 anomaly detection.

Abstract: Using data from mobile network utilization in Norway, we showcase the
possibility of monitoring the state of communication and mobility networks with
a non-invasive, low-cost method. This method transforms the network data into a
model within the framework of reservoir computing and then measures the model's
performance on proxy tasks. Experimentally, we show how the performance on
these proxies relates to the state of the network. A key advantage of this
approach is that it uses readily available data sets and leverages the
reservoir computing framework for an inexpensive and largely agnostic method.
Data from mobile network utilization is available in an anonymous, aggregated
form with multiple snapshots per day. This data can be treated like a weighted
network. Reservoir computing allows the use of weighted, but untrained networks
as a machine learning tool. The network, initialized as a so-called echo state
network (ESN), projects incoming signals into a higher dimensional space, on
which a single trained layer operates. This consumes less energy than deep
neural networks in which every weight of the network is trained. We use
neuroscience inspired tasks and trained our ESN model to solve them. We then
show how the performance depends on certain network configurations and also how
it visibly decreases when perturbing the network. While this work serves as

Motivation: 现有的模型合并技术通常独立处理每一层，忽略了深度网络中层间依赖关系，导致分布不匹配问题，特别是在激活基方法中早期层变化无法正确反映到下游层

Method: Chain of Merges (CoM)方法，采用自回归方式逐层合并，更新激活统计量，显式考虑层间交互作用，通过一系列条件最优更新生成一致的合并模型

Result: 在标准基准测试中，CoM方法实现了最先进的性能表现，有效缓解了由协变量偏移引起的性能下降

Conclusion: CoM通过考虑层间依赖关系的合并方法，成功解决了深度网络模型合并中的内部协变量偏移问题，为多任务模型融合提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models has become a standard pathway to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of domains, leading to a
proliferation of task-specific model variants. As the number of such
specialized modules in-creases, merging them into a unified model without
retraining has become a critical challenge. Existing merging techniques often
rely on interference heuristics,importance weighting, or activation matching
while treating each layer independently, thereby failing to account for the
inter-layer dependencies inherent in deep networks. This simplification leads
to distributional mismatches, especially inactivation-based methods, when
changes in early layers are not properly reflected in downstream ones. We
identify these mismatches as a form of internal covariate shift, comparable to
the phenomenon encountered in the initial phases of neural networks training.
To address it, we propose Chain of Merges (CoM), a layer-wise merging procedure
that updates activation statistics in an auto-regressive fashion, explicitly
accounting for cross-layer interactions. CoM produces a coherent merged model
through a series of conditionally optimal updates, effectively mitigating
degradation caused by covariate shift. Experiments on standard bench-marks
demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Result: GAN框架能有效检测由突然进料变异性引起的异常，混合量子/经典方法提高了异常检测率

Conclusion: 混合量子/经典方法在解决复杂连续生物制造过程中的实际问题方面显示出巨大潜力

Abstract: The development of continuous biomanufacturing processes requires robust and
early anomaly detection, since even minor deviations can compromise yield and
stability, leading to disruptions in scheduling, reduced weekly production, and
diminished economic performance. These processes are inherently complex and
exhibit non-linear dynamics with intricate relationships between process
variables, thus making advanced methods for anomaly detection essential for
efficient operation. In this work, we present a novel framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing based on an
ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first establish a
benchmark dataset simulating both normal and anomalous operation regimes in a
continuous process for the production of a small molecule. We then demonstrate
the effectiveness of our GAN-based framework in detecting anomalies caused by
sudden feedstock variability. Finally, we evaluate the impact of using a hybrid
quantum/classical GAN approach with both a simulated quantum circuit and a real
photonic quantum processor on anomaly detection performance. We find that the
hybrid approach yields improved anomaly detection rates. Our work shows the
potential of hybrid quantum/classical approaches for solving real-world
problems in complex continuous biomanufacturing processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL算法优化期望累积奖励（无限轨迹的平均性能），但在实际部署中，个体轨迹的性能更重要，需要优化单个轨迹的长期表现

Method: 定义了时间平均增长率的Bellman算子，在乘法奖励动态下使用几何平均，对于更一般的奖励动态提出带N滑动窗口的修正几何平均作为估计器，并将其作为正则化器嵌入目标函数

Result: 在具有挑战性的模拟环境中评估，算法优于传统RL方法

Conclusion: 提出的算法能够同时受益于期望平均和时间平均，有效提升个体轨迹的长期性能

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically optimize the expected
cumulative reward, i.e., the expected value of the sum of scalar rewards an
agent receives over the course of a trajectory. The expected value averages the
performance over an infinite number of trajectories. However, when deploying
the agent in the real world, this ensemble average may be uninformative for the
performance of individual trajectories. Thus, in many applications, optimizing
the long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable.
In this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard
ensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term
performance of individual trajectories. We first define the Bellman operator
for the time-average growth rate. We then show that, under multiplicative
reward dynamics, the geometric mean aligns with the time-average growth rate.
To address more general and unknown reward dynamics, we propose a modified
geometric mean with $N$-sliding window that captures the path-dependency as an
estimator for the time-average growth rate. This estimator is embedded as a
regularizer into the objective, forming a practical algorithm and enabling the
policy to benefit from ensemble average and time-average simultaneously. We
evaluate our algorithm in challenging simulations, where it outperforms
conventional RL methods.

Motivation: 随着图数据规模扩大，双曲空间等黎曼流形数据空间受到关注，但现有的NML方法主要针对欧几里得空间且依赖坐标系选择，难以扩展到黎曼流形。

Method: 定义了反映黎曼流形几何结构的新NML（Rm-NML），扩展了现有NML计算技术到黎曼流形，并推导了在黎曼对称空间上简化计算的方法。

Result: 提出的Rm-NML在坐标变换下具有不变性，在欧几里得空间自然参数化下与传统NML一致，并成功计算了双曲空间上正态分布的Rm-NML。

Conclusion: Rm-NML为黎曼流形上的模型选择和遗憾最小化提供了几何感知的解决方案，特别适用于具有层次结构的图数据。

Abstract: In recent years, with the large-scale expansion of graph data, there has been
an increased focus on Riemannian manifold data spaces other than Euclidean
space. In particular, the development of hyperbolic spaces has been remarkable,
and they have high expressive power for graph data with hierarchical
structures. Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) is employed in regret
minimization and model selection. However, existing formulations of NML have
been developed primarily in Euclidean spaces and are inherently dependent on
the choice of coordinate systems, making it non-trivial to extend NML to
Riemannian manifolds. In this study, we define a new NML that reflects the
geometric structure of Riemannian manifolds, called the Riemannian manifold NML
(Rm-NML). This Rm-NML is invariant under coordinate transformations and
coincides with the conventional NML under the natural parameterization in
Euclidean space. We extend existing computational techniques for NML to the
setting of Riemannian manifolds. Furthermore, we derive a method to simplify
the computation of Rm-NML on Riemannian symmetric spaces, which encompass data
spaces of growing interest such as hyperbolic spaces. To illustrate the
practical application of our proposed method, we explicitly computed the Rm-NML
for normal distributions on hyperbolic spaces.

Abstract: Recent advances in Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD) have leveraged
generative models for 3D molecular generation, predominantly evaluating model
performance by binding affinity to target proteins. However, practical drug
discovery necessitates high binding affinity along with synthetic feasibility
and selectivity, critical properties that were largely neglected in previous
evaluations. To address this gap, we identify fundamental limitations of
conventional diffusion-based generative models in effectively guiding molecule
generation toward these diverse pharmacological properties. We propose CByG, a
novel framework extending Bayesian Flow Network into a gradient-based
conditional generative model that robustly integrates property-specific
guidance. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme
incorporating practical benchmarks for binding affinity, synthetic feasibility,
and selectivity, overcoming the limitations of conventional evaluation methods.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CByG framework
significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple essential evaluation
criteria, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world drug
discovery applications.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning can greatly improve
exploration and robustness. Approximate Bayesian approaches have recently been
popularized to quantify uncertainty in model-free algorithms. However, so far
the focus has been on improving the accuracy of the posterior approximation,
instead of studying the accuracy of the prior and likelihood assumptions
underlying the posterior. In this work, we demonstrate that there is a cold
posterior effect in Bayesian deep Q-learning, where contrary to theory,
performance increases when reducing the temperature of the posterior. To
identify and overcome likely causes, we challenge common assumptions made on
the likelihood and priors in Bayesian model-free algorithms. We empirically
study prior distributions and show through statistical tests that the common
Gaussian likelihood assumption is frequently violated. We argue that developing
more suitable likelihoods and priors should be a key focus in future Bayesian
reinforcement learning research and we offer simple, implementable solutions
for better priors in deep Q-learning that lead to more performant Bayesian
algorithms.

Result: 研究发现校准良好的分类器仍可能浪费计算资源，常见校准方法不保留样本排序，错误校准的网络有时表现更好

Conclusion: 失败预测比校准更能反映早退模型的真实性能，是设计和评估早退模型更可靠的基础

Abstract: Early-exit models speed up inference by attaching internal classifiers to
intermediate layers of the model and allowing computation to stop once a
prediction satisfies an exit criterion. Most early-exit methods rely on
confidence-based exit strategies, which motivated some works to calibrate
intermediate classifiers to improve the performance of the entire model. In
this paper, we show that calibration measures can be misleading indicators of
the performance of multi-exit models: a well-calibrated classifier may still
waste computation, and common calibration methods do not preserve the sample
ranking within a classifier. We demonstrate empirical cases where miscalibrated
networks outperform calibrated ones. As an alternative, we propose to use
failure prediction as a more useful proxy for early-exit model performance.
Unlike calibration, failure prediction accounts for changes in the ranking of
samples and shows a strong correlation with efficiency improvements, making it
a more dependable basis for designing and evaluating early-exit models.

Conclusion: SNN-DT通过将序列建模与神经形态效率相结合，为嵌入式可穿戴设备上的实时低功耗控制开辟了新途径

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents based on Transformer architectures have
achieved impressive performance on sequential decision-making tasks, but their
reliance on dense matrix operations makes them ill-suited for
energy-constrained, edge-oriented platforms. Spiking neural networks promise
ultra-low-power, event-driven inference, yet no prior work has seamlessly
merged spiking dynamics with return-conditioned sequence modeling. We present
the Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN-DT), which embeds Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire neurons into each self-attention block, trains end-to-end
via surrogate gradients, and incorporates biologically inspired three-factor
plasticity, phase-shifted spike-based positional encodings, and a lightweight
dendritic routing module. Our implementation matches or exceeds standard
Decision Transformer performance on classic control benchmarks (CartPole-v1,
MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, Pendulum-v1) while emitting fewer than ten spikes
per decision, an energy proxy suggesting over four orders-of-magnitude
reduction in per inference energy. By marrying sequence modeling with
neuromorphic efficiency, SNN-DT opens a pathway toward real-time, low-power
control on embedded and wearable devices.

Method: 使用加纳、德国和美国三个地理区域的序列化贷款审批数据集，评估LLM的零样本和上下文学习能力

Result: 序列化格式选择显著影响LLM的性能和公平性，某些格式如GReat和LIFT能提高F1分数但加剧公平性差距；ICL相对零样本基线提升性能4.9-59.6%，但对公平性的影响因数据集而异

Conclusion: 需要有效的表格数据表示方法和公平性感知模型来提高LLM在金融决策中的可靠性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes
decision-making tasks, such as loan approvals. While their applications expand
across domains, LLMs struggle to process tabular data, ensuring fairness and
delivering reliable predictions. In this work, we assess the performance and
fairness of LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from three geographically
distinct regions: Ghana, Germany, and the United States. Our evaluation focuses
on the model's zero-shot and in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Our
results reveal that the choice of serialization (Serialization refers to the
process of converting tabular data into text formats suitable for processing by
LLMs.) format significantly affects both performance and fairness in LLMs, with
certain formats such as GReat and LIFT yielding higher F1 scores but
exacerbating fairness disparities. Notably, while ICL improved model
performance by 4.9-59.6% relative to zero-shot baselines, its effect on
fairness varied considerably across datasets. Our work underscores the
importance of effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware
models to improve the reliability of LLMs in financial decision-making.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown promise as solvers for
Boolean Satisfiability Problems (SATs) by operating on graph representations of
logical formulas. However, their performance degrades sharply on harder
instances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental
architectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation
through the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local
connectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random
k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature
decreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based
SAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range
dependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations.
We validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm
that curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used
to predict performance. Finally, we connect our findings to design principles
of existing solvers and outline promising directions for future work.

Abstract: Recent studies show the promise of large language models (LLMs) for few-shot

inspiration from human learning processes, we introduce InsightTab, an insight
distillation framework guided by principles of divide-and-conquer, easy-first,
and reflective learning. Our approach integrates rule summarization, strategic
exemplification, and insight reflection through deep collaboration between LLMs
and data modeling techniques. The obtained insights enable LLMs to better align
their general knowledge and capabilities with the particular requirements of
specific tabular tasks. We extensively evaluate InsightTab on nine datasets.
The results demonstrate consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.
Ablation studies further validate the principle-guided distillation process,
while analyses emphasize InsightTab's effectiveness in leveraging labeled data

distinct evaluation approaches: quantitative signal quality indices to
objectively benchmark device performance; rhythm-based analyzes of
physiological parameters such as heart rate and heart rate variability; machine
learning classification tasks to assess application-relevant predictive
utility; morphological analysis of ECG features including amplitude and
interval parameters; and investigations of the effects of electrode projection
angle given by the textile / body shape, with all analyzes stratified by sex to
elucidate sex-specific influences. Evaluations were conducted across various
activity phases representing real-world conditions. The results demonstrate
that the textile system achieves signal quality highly concordant with
reference devices in both rhythm and morphological analyses, exhibits robust
classification performance, and enables identification of key sex-specific
determinants affecting signal acquisition. These findings underscore the
practical viability of textile-based ECG garments for physiological monitoring
as well as psychophysiological state detection. Moreover, we identify the
importance of incorporating sex-specific design considerations to ensure

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) present a transformative approach
for smart grid modeling by integrating physical laws directly into learning
frameworks, addressing critical challenges of data scarcity and physical
consistency in conventional data-driven methods. This paper evaluates PINNs'
capabilities as surrogate models for smart grid dynamics, comparing their
performance against XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression across three
key experiments: interpolation, cross-validation, and episodic trajectory
prediction. By training PINNs exclusively through physics-based loss functions
(enforcing power balance, operational constraints, and grid stability) we
demonstrate their superior generalization, outperforming data-driven models in
error reduction. Notably, PINNs maintain comparatively lower MAE in dynamic
grid operations, reliably capturing state transitions in both random and
expert-driven control scenarios, while traditional models exhibit erratic
performance. Despite slight degradation in extreme operational regimes, PINNs
consistently enforce physical feasibility, proving vital for safety-critical
applications. Our results contribute to establishing PINNs as a
paradigm-shifting tool for smart grid surrogation, bridging data-driven
flexibility with first-principles rigor. This work advances real-time grid
control and scalable digital twins, emphasizing the necessity of physics-aware
architectures in mission-critical energy systems.

specialized sensors. In this paper, we introduce the OceAn Salinity Imputation
System (OASIS), a novel diffusion adversarial framework designed to address
these challenges.

of fundamental importance. In this work, we establish the linear convergence of
stochastic gradient descent / flow in training over-parameterized two layer
PINNs for a general class of activation functions in the sense of high
probability. These results extend the existing result [18] in which gradient
descent was analyzed. The challenge of the analysis lies in handling the
dynamic randomness introduced by stochastic optimization methods. The key of
the analysis lies in ensuring the positive definiteness of suitable Gram
matrices during the training. The analysis sheds insight into the dynamics of
the optimization process, and provides guarantees on the neural networks
trained by stochastic algorithms.

Abstract: Decision theories offer principled methods for making choices under various
types of uncertainty. Algorithms that implement these theories have been
successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems, including
materials and drug discovery. Indeed, they are desirable since they can
adaptively gather information to make better decisions in the future, resulting
in data-efficient workflows. In scientific discovery, where experiments are
costly, these algorithms can thus significantly reduce the cost of
experimentation. Theoretical analyses of these algorithms are crucial for
understanding their behavior and providing valuable insights for developing
next-generation algorithms. However, theoretical analyses in the literature are
often inaccessible to non-experts. This monograph aims to provide an
accessible, self-contained introduction to the theoretical analysis of commonly
used probabilistic decision-making algorithms, including bandit algorithms,
Bayesian optimization, and tree search algorithms. Only basic knowledge of
probability theory and statistics, along with some elementary knowledge about
Gaussian processes, is assumed.

*Yunwoo Kim,Junhyuk Hwang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 基于情感和时间特征的机器学习模型预测社交媒体参与度（评论和点赞），使用梯度提升回归器，点赞预测效果很好（R²=0.98），但评论预测较差（R²=0.41），表明评论受更多复杂因素影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何利用情感和时间特征来预测社交媒体内容（特别是音乐）的参与度，探索情感元数据对用户参与行为的影响。

Method: 使用包含600首歌曲的数据集，标注了效价、唤醒度和情感指标，采用HistGradientBoostingRegressor多目标回归模型，对经过对数变换的参与度比率进行训练。

Result: 模型在点赞预测上表现优异（R²=0.98），但在评论预测上效果较差（R²=0.41），表明情感和时间元数据结合现有观看次数能有效预测未来参与度。

Conclusion: 点赞主要受情感和曝光信号驱动，而评论受到更多当前特征集未包含的复杂因素影响，需要进一步研究其他影响因素。

Abstract: We present a machine learning approach for predicting social media engagement
(comments and likes) from emotional and temporal features. The dataset contains
600 songs with annotations for valence, arousal, and related sentiment metrics.
A multi target regression model based on HistGradientBoostingRegressor is
trained on log transformed engagement ratios to address skewed targets.
Performance is evaluated with both a custom order of magnitude accuracy and
standard regression metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R^2).
Results show that emotional and temporal metadata, together with existing view
counts, predict future engagement effectively. The model attains R^2 = 0.98 for
likes but only R^2 = 0.41 for comments. This gap indicates that likes are
largely driven by readily captured affective and exposure signals, whereas
comments depend on additional factors not represented in the current feature
set.

TL;DR: 提出ActSub方法，利用分类头权重矩阵的奇异值分解将激活分解为关键和次要成分，针对不同分布偏移程度采用不同策略进行OOD检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保深度学习模型在现实应用中的可靠性，需要有效区分训练分布内(ID)和分布外(OOD)样本，现有方法在处理大分布偏移和小分布偏移时存在不同挑战

Method: 使用奇异值分解将分类头权重矩阵分解，得到对分类输出贡献最大和最小的成分。对于大分布偏移(Far-OOD)，利用次要成分子空间；对于小分布偏移(Near-OOD)，仅考虑关键成分子空间

Result: 在各种标准OOD基准测试中取得了最先进的结果

Conclusion: 通过分析模型激活的不同成分子空间，针对不同分布偏移程度采用相应策略，能够有效提升OOD检测性能

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications,
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to
the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD).
In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular
value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to
decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components,
which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier
output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively
distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large
distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective
leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that
are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of
smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods
profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant
component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two
findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in various standard OOD benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个统计学习框架，将纵向回归断点设计(LRDD)从传统预测扩展到预测未来心理健康评分的不连续性和斜率变化，用于评估COVID-19等事件对美国各县焦虑水平的社区特异性影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 估计社区特异性心理健康事件影响对公共卫生政策至关重要。传统预测方法提供有限洞察，而准实验设计如LRDD能从观察数据中推导更可能具有因果关系的效应。

Method: 将LRDD适应到统计学习框架中，基于位置的历史评分、动态协变量(其他运行评估)和外生变量(静态表征)来预测未来的不连续性(时间特异性变化)和斜率变化(线性轨迹)。

Result: 预测COVID-19事件导致的美国各县焦虑不连续性任务困难但可行，模型复杂度增加时效果更好，最佳结果来自整合外生和动态协变量。相比传统静态社区表征有显著改进(不连续性r=+0.46，斜率r=+0.65)。

Conclusion: 不连续性预测为估计潜在未来或假设事件对特定社区的异质性影响开辟了新可能性，展示了统计学习框架在社区心理健康效应评估中的价值。

Abstract: Estimating community-specific mental health effects of local events is vital
for public health policy. While forecasting mental health scores alone offers
limited insights into the impact of events on community well-being,
quasi-experimental designs like the Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity
Design (LRDD) from econometrics help researchers derive more effects that are
more likely to be causal from observational data. LRDDs aim to extrapolate the
size of changes in an outcome (e.g. a discontinuity in running scores for
anxiety) due to a time-specific event. Here, we propose adapting LRDDs beyond
traditional forecasting into a statistical learning framework whereby future
discontinuities (i.e. time-specific shifts) and changes in slope (i.e. linear
trajectories) are estimated given a location's history of the score, dynamic
covariates (other running assessments), and exogenous variables (static
representations). Applying our framework to predict discontinuities in the
anxiety of US counties from COVID-19 events, we found the task was difficult
but more achievable as the sophistication of models was increased, with the
best results coming from integrating exogenous and dynamic covariates. Our
approach shows strong improvement ($r=+.46$ for discontinuity and $r = +.65$
for slope) over traditional static community representations. Discontinuity
forecasting raises new possibilities for estimating the idiosyncratic effects
of potential future or hypothetical events on specific communities.

TL;DR: SLAC开发了SNL框架和Auto-SNL工具，用于在FPGA上部署实时机器学习推理模型，解决了高能物理实验中TB/s级数据流的实时处理挑战，相比现有工具hls4ml在延迟和资源利用方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LCLS-II自由电子激光器产生高达1MHz的X射线脉冲，探测器数据吞吐量超过1TB/s，传统数据传输和存储成本过高，需要实时机器学习进行数据压缩，但现有方案延迟过高。

Method: 开发SLAC神经网络库(SNL)框架，支持在FPGA上动态更新模型权重而无需重新综合；推出Auto-SNL Python扩展工具，将Python神经网络模型自动转换为SNL兼容的高级综合代码。

Result: 在Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA上进行基准测试，与hls4ml工具对比显示，SNL在大多数神经网络架构中实现了竞争性或更优的延迟性能，某些情况下还能节省FPGA资源。

Conclusion: SNL框架展示了强大的适应性，为高能物理、医学成像、机器人等多个领域的研究人员提供了新的实时机器学习部署解决方案。

Abstract: The LCLS-II Free Electron Laser (FEL) will generate X-ray pulses for beamline
experiments at rates of up to 1~MHz, with detectors producing data throughputs
exceeding 1 TB/s. Managing such massive data streams presents significant
challenges, as transmission and storage infrastructures become prohibitively
expensive. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution for real-time data
reduction, but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency, making
them unsuitable for high-speed experimental environments. To address these
challenges, SLAC developed the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL), a specialized
framework designed to deploy real-time ML inference models on
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). SNL's key feature is the ability to
dynamically update model weights without requiring FPGA resynthesis, enhancing
flexibility for adaptive learning applications. To further enhance usability
and accessibility, we introduce Auto-SNL, a Python extension that streamlines
the process of converting Python-based neural network models into
SNL-compatible high-level synthesis code. This paper presents a benchmark
comparison against hls4ml, the current state-of-the-art tool, across multiple
neural network architectures, fixed-point precisions, and synthesis
configurations targeting a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. The results showed that SNL
achieves competitive or superior latency in most tested architectures, while in
some cases also offering FPGA resource savings. This adaptation demonstrates
SNL's versatility, opening new opportunities for researchers and academics in
fields such as high-energy physics, medical imaging, robotics, and many more.

TL;DR: 本文提出了UniMLR新范式，利用正标签间的排序信息来建模类别相关性，而不是将所有正标签视为同等重要，统一了多标签排序中的排序和分类任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多标签排序框架只利用标签二分为正负集合的信息，没有充分利用正标签之间的排序信息，无法捕捉类别的重要性和相关性差异。

Method: 提出UniMLR方法，通过正标签的排序来建模隐式的类别相关性概率分布，并创建了8个合成数据集(Ranked MNISTs)来解决数据稀缺和标注偏差问题。

Result: 统计证明该方法能准确学习与真实排序一致的表示，且与底层重要性值成比例。在真实和合成数据集上的实验验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: UniMLR通过利用正标签排序信息，为多标签排序提供了新的解决方案，能够更好地建模类别相关性，并在实验中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Existing multi-label ranking (MLR) frameworks only exploit information
deduced from the bipartition of labels into positive and negative sets.
Therefore, they do not benefit from ranking among positive labels, which is the
novel MLR approach we introduce in this paper. We propose UniMLR, a new MLR
paradigm that models implicit class relevance/significance values as
probability distributions using the ranking among positive labels, rather than
treating them as equally important. This approach unifies ranking and
classification tasks associated with MLR. Additionally, we address the
challenges of scarcity and annotation bias in MLR datasets by introducing eight
synthetic datasets (Ranked MNISTs) generated with varying
significance-determining factors, providing an enriched and controllable
experimental environment. We statistically demonstrate that our method
accurately learns a representation of the positive rank order, which is
consistent with the ground truth and proportional to the underlying
significance values. Finally, we conduct comprehensive empirical experiments on
both real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating the value of our proposed
framework.

Motivation: 解决心率预测在现实部署中面临的数据异质性挑战，包括设备源差异（不同设备特征集不同）和用户差异（不同用户生理模式不同）

Method: 使用随机特征丢弃策略处理设备源异质性，采用时间感知注意力模块和对比学习目标来处理用户异质性，学习对两种异质性都不敏感的潜在表示

Result: 在ParroTao和FitRec数据集上分别比现有基线方法性能提升17%和15%，学习到的表示具有很强的判别能力

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效处理心率预测中的数据异质性问题，学习到的表示在下游应用中具有实用价值

Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and
fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in
real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source
heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and
user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across
individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific
information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their
real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns
latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream
predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.
Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source
heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user
heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term
physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a
discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of
real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,
ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that
our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,
respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates
their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm
the practical value of our model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实医疗环境中多模态数据往往不完整或存在差异，现有方法需要完整模态数据或依赖人工选择策略，限制了在真实临床环境中的应用。

Method: 提出MoE-Health框架，使用专门的专家网络和动态门控机制，根据可用数据模态动态选择和组合相关专家，灵活适应不同的数据可用性场景。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上的三个关键临床预测任务中，MoE-Health相比现有多模态融合方法取得了更优的性能，并在不同模态可用性模式下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效整合多模态信息，在处理异构和不完整医疗数据方面提供改进的预测性能和鲁棒性，特别适合部署在数据可用性多样的医疗环境中。

Abstract: Healthcare systems generate diverse multimodal data, including Electronic
Health Records (EHR), clinical notes, and medical images. Effectively
leveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as
real-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing
approaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection
strategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where
data availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these
limitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework
designed for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health
architecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing
modalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging
specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach
dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data
modalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability
scenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical
clinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of
stay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate
that MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal
fusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality
availability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal
information, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in
handling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly
suitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous
data availability.

TL;DR: QR-LoRA是一种参数高效的微调方法，通过QR分解提取预训练权重的正交基，仅训练标量系数来大幅减少可训练参数数量，在GLUE任务上性能优于全微调和标准LoRA


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA变体使用SVD初始化更新矩阵，但SVD在大模型上计算昂贵且奇异向量难以解释，需要更高效和可解释的参数高效微调方法

Method: 使用带列主元的QR分解从预训练权重矩阵提取正交基，将LoRA更新表示为这些基向量的线性组合，仅训练标量系数

Result: 在GLUE任务上，QR-LoRA性能匹配或超过全微调、标准LoRA和SVD-LoRA，仅需601个参数（比全微调减少1000倍，比标准LoRA减少77倍）

Conclusion: QR-LoRA通过正交基表示提供清晰的结构化适应，大幅减少参数数量的同时保持优异性能，为大规模语言模型的高效微调提供了新思路

Abstract: The growing scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated the
development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) has emerged as a promising approach, reducing the number of trainable
parameters by applying low-rank updates to pretrained weights. While standard
LoRA learns both update factors directly, several recent variants first
initialize those matrices via an SVD of the pretrained weights -- an operation
that can be expensive on large models and yields singular vectors that are not
always easy to interpret. In this work, we extract an orthonormal basis from
the pretrained weight matrix using QR decomposition with column pivoting, and
then express the LoRA update as a linear combination of these basis vectors --
training only the scalar coefficients, which imposes clear structure on
adaptation and drastically reduces parameter count. Experiments across GLUE
tasks show that QR-LoRA matches or exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning,
standard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA (LoRA with update matrices initialized via singular
value decomposition) with as few as 601 parameters -- a reduction of over 1000x
compared to full fine-tuning and 77x fewer than typical LoRA setups.

TL;DR: FLIP是一个基于transformer的变分自编码器，结合潜在扩散模型生成异构表格数据，在隐私保护（Rényi差分隐私）和公平性（通过潜在空间对齐和平衡采样）方面提供综合解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着GDPR、HIPAA等隐私法规和AI责任框架的实施，真实数据的使用面临更多限制。合成数据生成成为风险感知数据共享和模型开发的有前景解决方案，特别是在医疗等敏感领域的表格数据应用中需要同时解决隐私和公平性问题。

Method: 提出FLIP框架：1）使用transformer-based VAE和潜在扩散模型生成表格数据；2）训练时采用Rényi差分隐私约束；3）通过RDP兼容的平衡采样处理输入空间公平性；4）在潜在空间使用Centered Kernel Alignment对齐不同保护组的神经元激活模式，促进统计独立性。

Conclusion: FLIP为任务无关的公平性数据生成提供了一个有效的隐私保护解决方案，通过在输入空间和潜在空间同时处理公平性问题，在隐私约束下实现了公平性的显著提升。

Abstract: As privacy regulations such as the GDPR and HIPAA and responsibility
frameworks for artificial intelligence such as the AI Act gain traction, the
ethical and responsible use of real-world data faces increasing constraints.
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution to risk-aware
data sharing and model development, particularly for tabular datasets that are
foundational to sensitive domains such as healthcare. To address both privacy
and fairness concerns in this setting, we propose FLIP (Fair Latent
Intervention under Privacy guarantees), a transformer-based variational
autoencoder augmented with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular
data. Unlike the typical setup in fairness-aware data generation, we assume a
task-agnostic setup, not reliant on a fixed, defined downstream task, thus
offering broader applicability. To ensure privacy, FLIP employs R\'enyi
differential privacy (RDP) constraints during training and addresses fairness
in the input space with RDP-compatible balanced sampling that accounts for
group-specific noise levels across multiple sampling rates. In the latent
space, we promote fairness by aligning neuron activation patterns across
protected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure
extending the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This alignment
encourages statistical independence between latent representations and the
protected feature. Empirical results demonstrate that FLIP effectively provides
significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse
downstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.
